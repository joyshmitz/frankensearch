      "title": "Unicode and Control Character Stress",
      "content": "This adversarial fixture combines multilingual text, confusable characters, and escaped control bytes in one payload to validate canonicalization safety. It is designed to ensure tokenization remains deterministic, indexing does not panic, and query matching still produces stable behavior. The content intentionally mixes normal prose with edge symbols that frequently break naive parsers.",
