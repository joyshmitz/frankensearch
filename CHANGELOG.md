# Changelog

All notable changes to [frankensearch](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch) are documented here.

Entries correspond to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases) unless noted otherwise. Tags that share a commit with another release are called out explicitly. Each entry links to representative commits using full commit URLs.

Release history through [v1.10.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/v1.10.0) and the [0.5.0 crate bundle](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/crates-v0.5.0), published 2026-09-08. All 13 crate versions are also published on crates.io. The latest update covers every landed commit from v1.9.1 through v1.10.0 using git diffs, release metadata and checked-in Beads; see [research coverage](CHANGELOG_RESEARCH.md). Earlier history is preserved. **v1.4.1 and v1.4.2 are git tags with no GitHub Release.**

Scope window: the release reconstruction covers v1.9.1 → v1.10.0 and their 2026-09-08 publication records. The subsequent-change inventory covers Quill fixes, warm-daemon streaming, model-receipt reuse, executable acceptance, the GH #43/#46 indexing and loader work, and dependency qualification through 2026-09-12 (UTC). The 0.6.0 library family was published to crates.io on September 12; its plain git tag is not a GitHub Release, and the next fsfs binary release remains pending.

## Changes since fsfs 1.10.0 / crates 0.5.0

Changes on `main` after the 2026-09-08 publication. Library changes through
[`dd093fb2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/dd093fb230404ab08be2ed6f27776ed6c4796485)
are included in the September 12 crate publication described below. fsfs CLI
changes remain unreleased; fsfs is still 1.10.0. Gauntlet and release-checker
changes describe repository tooling, not published library capabilities.
Library corrections after that publication, including the Potion dependency
identity repair below, also remain unreleased.

### Added

- **Progressive search can reuse the warm fsfs daemon.** On Unix, `fsfs search --stream` now uses the daemon by default and accepts `--daemon`; `--no-daemon` retains direct execution. Previously, streaming bypassed the daemon and could not reuse its loaded models. The daemon now sends an attestation, Initial results, optional refinement, and a terminal frame as they become available. JSONL and TOON clients consume the same validated sequence, and complete cached replays are explicitly marked. Frames, queued bytes, retained cache entries and admitted clients are bounded; disconnects stop publication and drain owned inference. The legacy stdio response remains available. [Implementation](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/35e8c2312e9c5529a929862f530bfcaafc8ff5d4); [completed workstream and validation](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/blob/462035f39d3c70f8705312b8ff7b88c5837b612f/.beads/issues.jsonl#L838) (`bd-fsfs-progressive-daemon-dq48i`).

- **`Model2VecEmbedder::load_shared` / `load_shared_with_name` reuse the process-wide instance ([#46](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/issues/46)).** While a caller retains the model, later loads in the same process reuse its parsed 500,353-piece Unigram tokenizer and 512 MB matrix. Artifact admission runs before cache lookup; replacing or rewriting model files invalidates the receipt and requires full hashing. A `Weak` cache releases the matrix when the last caller drops its `Arc`. `detect_fast_embedder` and lazy downloads use this path; the doctor loader probe reads the current disk artifacts independently. A new CLI process still pays the full load because Tokenizers 0.23 rebuilds its Unigram trie when deserializing. Published in `frankensearch-embed` 0.3.0, whose producer implementation revision also names 0.3.0.

### Changed

- **FrankenTUI 0.7.0, wide 1.7.0, crc32fast 1.5.1, and TOML 1.1.6.** The terminal framework, SIMD, checksum, and configuration updates pass their affected consumer suites. The Wide update also passes the real native F32 MiniLM certificate, batching, and repeatability check on x86. These checks establish compatibility, not a measured speedup. Full release qualification remains pending; see the [upgrade log](docs/planning/UPGRADE_LOG.md).

- **Model producer identities name the updated Tokenizers and FastEmbed dependencies.** Tokenizers 0.23.2 and FastEmbed 6.0.3 pass the existing Potion, MiniLM, Snowflake, and Nomic conformance checks without changing their vector certificates. Historical manifest fingerprints remain covered. The corrected producer identities require rebuilding semantic indexes made by the prior producers. The initial Asupersync 0.4.11 attempt failed the caller-visible shadow latency guard; the published family subsequently moved to 0.5.0 with the shadow execution changes described below. Earlier dependency checks do not qualify that later combined graph. See the [dependency qualification record](docs/planning/UPGRADE_LOG.md).

- **Native HNSW persistence now records the source-row map.** Metadata format v7 binds graph origins to the physical vector rows and their source extent. Append preserves graph origins when sorted vector rows move, and refuses changed or deleted old vectors, duplicate IDs, and mismatched source maps with an explicit rebuild disposition. Old v6 sidecars require rebuilding. The validation still reads the full source, and loading/saving still processes the whole graph; this is not a constant-cost append claim. [Persistent mapping and append](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/ecbc659815a418d44a9aad949b374ac7b0999f2b); [source-map refusal](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/8f429d2ea204f18870705406ff19a69258dbfeff).

- **The published 0.3.0 embedder changes the stored producer revision.** Model2Vec first moved to adapter 0.2.7 during preparation; the final package bump also changes its implementation revision to 0.3.0. fsfs and strict library admission require that exact producer identity even when the embedding space and output certificate are unchanged. Rebuild indexes made by earlier producers, including 0.2.6 and 0.2.7, before using the new adapter. [Initial adapter change](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/c92d193c0efcb445ca51863c7cbbb1acb50ef781); [published package bump](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/347be73ebad6d0172df99ec78c394e2095ece8a4); [fsfs admission](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/blob/90e8fb147db19741c0f9205aa456d1e9b1362034/crates/frankensearch-fsfs/src/runtime.rs#L15409).

- **Model2Vec loading no longer holds the safetensors file and the decoded matrix at the same time ([#46](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/issues/46)).** The loader read the whole `model.safetensors` into a `Vec<u8>`, deserialized over that buffer and then materialised a second full `Vec<f32>` — two live copies of a half-gigabyte artifact. It now parses only the header, runs every admission check (receipt, dtype, 2-D shape, exact byte count, attested dimension, identity) against the shape that header reports, and only then streams the tensor into its final buffer in 1 MiB reads. Decoding is unchanged — the same little-endian `f32::from_le_bytes` over the same bytes in the same order — and a real-model regression asserts the streamed matrix is bit-identical to the previous whole-buffer decode, as are the embeddings it feeds. Measured on the registered `potion-multilingual-128M` (F32 `[500353, 256]`, 512,361,560 B), median of 9 runs on an otherwise idle host: peak RSS for one cold load 1,801,240,576 B → 1,288,880,128 B (**−512,360,448 B, −28.4%** — exactly one copy of the 512,361,472-byte tensor), page reclaims 112,001 → 80,792 (−27.9%), load-and-embed wall time 810 ms → 729 ms (−10.0%). The dtype is now checked outright rather than implied by a byte-count comparison, and a truncated, over-long or absurd-header artifact is refused by name.

- **Established daemon errors no longer silently replay a search in direct mode.** Policy, producer, generation and protocol disagreements are explicit failures; restart an incompatible daemon or select `--no-daemon`. Once Initial has been delivered, the client cannot replay it, switch generations or hide a failed terminal. Startup connection failure retains the existing direct fallback. [Implementation](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/35e8c2312e9c5529a929862f530bfcaafc8ff5d4).
- **The normal real-host quality gate now executes Quill's native correctness witness.** Real Quill and pinned Tantivy tests, their oracle-validator negatives, and typed-query replay regressions run under a bounded execution budget, with nonzero counts checked against Cargo's inventory. Missing oracle support, timeout and incomplete output fail the stage. The complete gauntlet remains a separate required release/conformance lane; bounded success does not override its failures. [Gate and regressions](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/820e83e1e6df618f3db7b655c55882d307fa89af).
- **The executable quickstart gate requires both search tiers and actual progressive results.** The Linux DSR lane builds and installs into a private root, checks executable byte identity, and requires ranked hybrid and vector-only results, Initial/Refined records, authoritative generation artifacts, and the model receipts actually admitted by the loaders. Eighteen failure controls cover model, result, generation, lifecycle and provenance failures. Supplied binaries retain an explicitly unknown source revision; the checker revision cannot qualify them as a source-bound release build. [Gate and receipt wiring](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/3d1c2fddb09641153cc7d66a61f835751a4b1538); [isolated Cargo discovery](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/8789e0449eb01e3e6250cc4358eef003366d4ff9).

### Fixed

- **Concurrent local anti-rollback publishers no longer expose an unfinished record.**
  Readers and competing publishers wait for the active writer's durability barrier,
  so same-base attempts produce one winner and typed conflicts. If a writer dies
  with a torn record, later operations still refuse the unresolved head. New root
  entries and completed records are synced before acknowledgement. This library
  correction follows the September 12 publication and remains unreleased.
  [Fix and cross-process regressions](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/a4e86336761d982783ab0f4fec002cbbcee0e6bf).

- **Potion now identifies the SafeTensors version it actually uses.** The
  September 12 dependency update selected SafeTensors 0.8.0, but the published
  embedder's producer protocol still named 0.7.0. The corrected producer
  requires rebuilding indexes carrying that earlier identity, including those
  made with the published 0.3.0 adapter. Historical fingerprints and numerical
  certificates are unchanged; real-Potion certification and streamed decoding
  still pass. A fresh-process check now compares the declared protocol with
  Cargo.lock. [Repair and regressions](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/b62074148d7fd38029818e638aa31f7699dc93fd).

- **Published Quill segment authentication streams from the same opened file that backs the mapping.** MANIFEST admission hashes the prefix in 16 KiB reads, then releases the file handle. A path rename cannot switch the bytes being authenticated, and malformed or truncated witnesses remain rejected. This avoids reading the witness through every mapped page while preserving the content check. [Implementation and descriptor/corruption regressions](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/b51b46ab90142c35668a74e19afab88219eefb7e).

- **Quill preserves safe ingest leases across tier merges ([#41](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/issues/41)).** Concat no longer burns a continuous writer's unused lease tail when every shard's next ID is beyond all published segment intervals. The 192-document, one-commit-per-document regression now produces 3 segments instead of 24, with IDs 0–191 and each original document identity preserved. Cross-shard merges still retire leases when needed to prevent overlapping intervals. The hole-ratio guard is unchanged; fragmentation across separate writer sessions remains unresolved.

- **One-shot indexing observes shutdown and memory pressure ([#43](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/issues/43)).** Plain `fsfs index` now binds SIGINT/SIGTERM to cancellation and checks it during discovery, model loading, document batches and publication. A second SIGINT within three seconds forces exit 130. Reaching the configured RSS threshold stops further work with a typed error, and one-shot batches now honor `embedding_batch_size` instead of a fixed 256 documents. These are cooperative checks: a synchronous loader may exceed the memory threshold before returning. An interrupted generation can require a retry before search; retaining the previous complete generation remains unresolved, so #43 stays open. [Implementation and regressions](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/90e8fb147db19741c0f9205aa456d1e9b1362034); [workstream](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/blob/00842910153e275632c1d4ca4a27ce13015e9a80/.beads/issues.jsonl#L978).

- **Registered FastEmbed loaders reuse valid model verification receipts.** They previously rehashed every artifact even when the authoritative receipt was valid. Receipt reuse now reaches the existing shared verifier; absent, stale or mismatched receipts still require full hashing, and execution-certificate checks remain mandatory. The real-model regression changes tokenizer bytes while restoring file size and modification time and requires hash rejection without rewriting the receipt. No latency improvement is claimed from this correctness work. [Implementation and regression](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/3d1c2fddb09641153cc7d66a61f835751a4b1538).
- **Typed-query fuzz replays can be published and reopened successfully.** Atomic publication changes the file's change-time; the retained descriptor now accounts for that transition while still checking inode identity, the final directory entry and the original content digest. A staged rewrite remains rejected even if its modification time is restored. The fuzz seed multiplier also matches the existing schema-pinned mapping. [Publication repair](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/802784a144a5270396ba3d945fe9fdadc825f7c0); [seed correction](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/acee3572cbf8dfc592d7ee3454f4c6b4ea8351c9); [adversarial regression](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/820e83e1e6df618f3db7b655c55882d307fa89af).
- **Quill: a failed replacement ingest can no longer be committed as a deletion ([#45](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/issues/45)).** `upsert` staged a tombstone for every identity the batch replaced and retained that proposal on the writer *before* batch admission ran and any row was accumulated. When the batch then failed — an admission refusal, a cancellation, a shard error partway through — the tombstone-only proposal survived, and the explicit `commit()` the retry guard demanded published it: a valid MANIFEST, every segment authenticating, serving none of the documents the batch meant to update (the engine half of cass#457). A failed replacement ingest now discards the whole scalar transaction — the proposal, any partially accumulated rows, and the retry guard — so the previous committed generation stays authoritative and the writer is left exactly as the caller found it. Regression tests cover the admission-refused shape, the cancelled-midway shape with real partial shard state, and the retry that follows.
- **Quill: publication gained a live-document floor ([#45](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/issues/45)).** `KeeperWriter::publish_with_intent` and `KeeperSnapshot::publish_owned_segments_with_intent` take a new `PublishIntent`; `validate_segment_transitions` refuses a `PreserveLiveDocuments` successor that would serve fewer live documents than the generation it replaces, with the new typed `KeeperError::LiveDocumentFloor` naming both generations and both counts. `commit`, upsert, Delta seals, bulk-load completion, tier merges and compaction publish with that intent; `delete_documents` and `delete_all` publish with `ExplicitDeletion` and are the explicit opt-in for a smaller generation (a full replace with fewer documents is `delete_all` followed by the new corpus). A `commit()` refused by the floor discards the unpublishable proposal instead of retaining it for a retry that could only fail again, so the writer stays usable. The raw `publish` / `publish_owned_segments` entry points keep their semantics: a proposal handed to them tombstone by tombstone is taken as the caller's explicit deletion intent. Reopening an already published pair is a shape check and never re-applies the floor, so a published `delete_all` still opens.
- **`frankensearch-quill` declares the asupersync floor it actually needs ([#44](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/issues/44)).** The initial fix raised the minimum from 0.4.4 to 0.4.10; the published Quill 0.3.0 family now requires 0.5.0. `Cx::is_cancelled`, the lock-free poll on the per-posting cancellation hot path, exists only from asupersync 0.4.10, so a consumer whose lockfile held 0.4.9 or below resolved the published 0.2.3 / 0.2.4 crates fine and then failed with three `E0599` errors from inside `index.rs` instead of a resolver error naming the requirement. `crates/frankensearch-quill/tests/asupersync_floor.rs` checks the declared requirement because a lockfile alone cannot catch an incorrect minimum.

### Known limitations

- **Native English Int8 MiniLM remains unqualified on ARM64 ([#47](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/issues/47)).** A real ARM64 run with verified model files reproduces the producer-certificate refusal. The loader continues to reject mismatched numerical output; replacing model files or weakening admission is not a remedy. Standard full binaries use ONNX quality embeddings by default. This result does not qualify the separate native F32 producer or establish a numerical root cause.

## [frankensearch 0.6.0](https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/frankensearch/0.6.0) — 2026-09-12

Registry-only publication: facade 0.6.0, rerank 0.4.0, and core, embed, index,
lexical, fusion, Quill, storage and durability 0.3.0. All ten downloaded archives
match their registry checksums and record source
[`dd093fb2`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/dd093fb230404ab08be2ed6f27776ed6c4796485),
also the target of the [annotated git tag](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/tree/frankensearch-v0.6.0).
No matching GitHub Release exists at the September 12 verification. fsfs, TUI
and ops retain their previous published versions; cross-platform binary and
full release qualification remain pending under `bd-dsbym`.

- **Consumers move together to Asupersync 0.5 and FrankenSQLite 0.4.** The public
  `Cx` boundary requires a shared runtime version; the component and facade
  version bumps reflect that change. Storage and durability use the matching
  registry family. [Dependency boundary](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/347be73ebad6d0172df99ec78c394e2095ece8a4).
- **Shadow comparison uses caller-owned blocking capacity.** Missing capacity
  sheds the comparison instead of polling a potentially blocking backend on the
  serving scheduler. Inline execution requires explicit opt-in; cancellation
  remains checked on both paths. [Isolation](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/06e053e1003c8ea12ab84dd774279489812de914);
  [admission and pooled regression](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/309ae25ad5d21ff8f547335739b8dcdf56ce1dc6).
- **Published mappings survive pathname replacement.** Inspection uses the
  already-open file backing the mapping and releases the descriptor after
  validation. This retains the immutable-file requirement and does not protect
  against in-place mutation. [Implementation and regressions](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/8b588964b01ffc00c06f5c43d7969162219dd88e).

The shared change inventory above covers the included loader, producer identity,
HNSW and Quill repairs. Archive publication and source attribution are verified
here; they do not establish a fresh full-suite or performance result.

## [fsfs 1.10.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/v1.10.0) / crates 0.5.0 -- 2026-09-08

Compare: [v1.9.1...v1.10.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/compare/v1.9.1...v1.10.0)

Both release tags bind to
[`9c5d8867`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/9c5d8867cbbc7edf696a24410a86af08402fc468).

### Delivered capability: native semantic selection and bounded inference

- **Native multilingual quality search.** An explicitly selected native
  multilingual model now reaches indexing, search, doctor, daemon reuse and
  append. Cache admission uses the selected producer identity, and conflicting
  native selections fail before cold initialization can hide the conflict as
  a timeout. Real-model tests cover cross-language retrieval and exact appended
  vectors.
- **An explicit native semantic source profile.** `--no-default-features
  --features semantic-native` builds Model2Vec, native quality inference and
  native reranking without FastEmbed or ONNX Runtime. It defaults to English
  native F32 quality; bare `download-models` provisions its configured fast/quality
  pair. Binary self-update and rollback application are refused for this
  profile, so upgrade it from source; update checks and backup listing remain
  available. Standard full binaries
  retain ONNX as their default quality producer. This does not complete the
  native migration or remove every transitive C/assembler requirement.
- **Caller-owned inference and cancellation.** Native detection, embedding and
  async reranking reject stopped blocking pools, including shutdown races that
  would otherwise run the work on the async executor. Workers check request
  cancellation between chunks and before publishing vectors or scores; an
  already-running tensor kernel is not preempted. Cold reranker initialization
  also uses the caller's pool. The facade's `native` and `rerank` exports now
  expose the same native API, and hash-dependent test/example targets declare
  that requirement so native-only all-target builds can compile.
- **Timeouts preserve useful work without poisoning caches.** Initialized
  quality models survive a timed-out daemon request and remain bound to their
  producer and pool generation. Rerank deadlines cover candidate-file reads,
  capacity waits and inference; expiration preserves the fused results, and
  that partial response does not enter the search cache.
  Cold reranker selection/loading runs on the caller's pool before that stage;
  it is outside the stage timer. Quality initialization admitted before a
  request timeout can finish into the model cache for a later request.
  Reranker discovery retries on later queries after a missing model is
  installed, while each query keeps its own selected-model cache identity.
- **Bit-preserving weight loading.** Aligned little-endian F32 model weights use
  a checked bulk copy; other layouts keep scalar decoding. Tests cover every
  alignment, exceptional float bit patterns and incomplete trailing bytes.
  This is a loading-path improvement, without a certified performance claim.

### Durability and dependency fixes

- **Durability locks end with their operation.** Protection, verification and
  repair explicitly release their file locks even when a duplicate descriptor
  remains open. Reader guards cover sidecar/CRC reads and mapping; a guard
  dropped in another process cannot unlock its creator's live operation.
  Tests retain a real duplicate and exercise actual RaptorQ corruption recovery.
  They establish the lock-lifetime defect; the holder behind the earlier
  intermittent parallel repair failure was not observed.
- **FrankenSQLite 0.3.18.** All 20 locked family members and four database
  consumers advance together from 0.3.17, retaining Asupersync 0.4.10. This
  incorporates upstream WAL journal-switch, read-only reader registration and
  Linux I/O cancellation fixes. The dependency update passed 396 FTS5-enabled
  storage/pipeline tests and commit/rollback reopen probes; no caller API
  migration was needed. See the [upstream release](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensqlite/releases/tag/v0.3.18).
- **ChaCha RNG backend correction.** The release lock uses `chacha20 0.10.2`.
  RustCrypto [yanked 0.10.1](https://github.com/RustCrypto/stream-ciphers/pull/583)
  for an SSE4.1 intrinsic in its SSE2 RNG backend. That RNG feature is present
  through the SQLite/PDF closure; the patch fixes it without changing the other
  locked dependency records. This does not claim a locally reproduced UB failure
  or a warning-free dependency audit.

### Crate publication and index migration

- **Rebuild existing semantic indexes.** All 13 publishable packages receive
  new versions from one source revision. The embedder adapter version changes
  Potion and ONNX manifest fingerprints, so 1.9.x indexes require an explicit
  rebuild from the original documents and configuration. Artifact checksums,
  output certificates and native producer fingerprints remain unchanged.
  Exact historical manifest reconstruction checks retain both 0.2.4 and 0.2.5.
- **Quill version metadata.** New manifests record engine 0.2.4; earlier
  manifest images remain readable and round-trip unchanged. Current oracle
  v7 and built-in profile v6 contracts bind the new crate versions while
  preserving historical identities. Older evidence remains readable but cannot
  admit a new run. The packaging check follows the actual `semantic-support`
  feature composition while retaining negative checks for malformed profiles.

Representative commits: [version and producer provenance update](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/1b67c0cb5cdeb6edeb8fa945b52da4d877215bef),
[Quill and packaging contracts](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/e82dee232b01243c10017132e5611f47f4e51f2f).

Version set: facade 0.5.0; fsfs 1.10.0; rerank 0.3.0;
core/index/lexical/fusion 0.2.5; embed 0.2.6;
storage/durability/quill 0.2.4; tui/ops 0.2.1. All 13 public crate archives match
their verified packages and this source revision. The ops crate remains
experimental. No performance win or complete native migration is claimed.

The final release revision passed all ten stages of the unchanged repository
quality gate, including seven real-model end-to-end tests. Six binary variants
were built with DSR on real hosts; GitHub Actions remained disabled.
All nine fresh public-registry consumer configurations passed, including actual
Quill and Tantivy matching/absent-term queries in the combined-feature run.
Five public installers and six actual 1.9.1 updates installed the expected binary
hashes and capability profiles.
The [crate bundle](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/crates-v0.5.0)
contains the actual public archives and a per-file evidence manifest. Its README
distinguishes surviving originals, reconstructed summaries and repeated Linux
checks after the original temporary evidence directory disappeared.

The full Linux x86_64 GNU binary requires glibc 2.43 or newer. Full Linux and
Apple Silicon binaries passed real Potion/ONNX indexing, refined search and
native reranking with the stock 500 ms quality budget. These checks do not
establish a universal cold-start deadline. Linux ARM lite ran under QEMU and
Intel macOS lite under Rosetta; neither is native hardware qualification.

The executed 1.9.1 index migration retained its existing 5,000 ms quality budget.
Search and append refused incompatible generations without changing the index;
rebuilding restored both search phases and subsequent appends. Rebuild using
the original documents and configuration:

```bash
fsfs index /original/source --full --index-dir /existing/index --config /original/config.toml
```

For this upgrade, the changed producer fingerprint triggers generation
replacement. Keep the original inputs; unchanged model bytes alone do not make
an older index compatible.

### Workstreams

Closed workstreams: [bd-durability-lock-release-v5lj4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/blob/9c5d8867cbbc7edf696a24410a86af08402fc468/.beads/issues.jsonl#L778)
records the descriptor-lifetime reproduction, repair and full-gate evidence.
The native work advances [bd-2ba5](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/blob/9c5d8867cbbc7edf696a24410a86af08402fc468/.beads/issues.jsonl#L102),
which remains open: ONNX is still the standard quality producer and the native
profile does not establish every native-default or toolchain criterion.
[bd-apqfa](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/blob/9c5d8867cbbc7edf696a24410a86af08402fc468/.beads/issues.jsonl#L711)
defines the release scope of six binary variants and 13 crates; the linked record is the frozen
release-source snapshot, before publication.

## [v1.9.1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/v1.9.1) -- 2026-09-07

Compare: <https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/compare/v1.9.0...v1.9.1>

Self-update now preserves the compiled Linux ABI and the full/lite capability
profile. Previously a Linux GNU binary selected the MUSL lite archive, removing
its semantic loaders despite a successful version update. Apple Silicon lite
builds also selected the full archive. Artifact selection now requires the exact
profile; an unavailable semantic build cannot silently become lite.

When upgrading an older Linux full binary, use the standard installer: the
artifact choice is made by the old executable, which this patch cannot change.
Older Apple Silicon lite installations should use `install.sh --lite` to retain
their profile.
The fix is covered against the six published 1.9.0 archives, including the
same-platform full/lite distinction and refusal of a missing semantic profile.

Six binary variants and two full installer aliases were published from
[`9d132a03`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/9d132a0315e12da0442aa7a943852091fe043037).
The unchanged quality gate passed all 10 stages. Linux and Apple Silicon full
binaries passed fresh indexing, refined search, applied native reranking, and
doctor. Direct 1.9.0 index opening and rollback preserved both vector files.
The 1.7/1.8 rebuild requirement and large-corpus refinement timeouts documented
under 1.9.0 remain; this patch does not change search performance or model identity.

## [crates-v0.4.3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/crates-v0.4.3) -- 2026-09-07

The crate bundle shares the v1.9.1 source commit. All 13 publishable members,
including facade `frankensearch 0.4.3` and `frankensearch-fsfs 1.9.1`, passed
package build verification and dry runs before publication. Every downloaded
public archive matches its registry checksum and the verified source revision.
The external public-registry consumer passed nine feature configurations,
including Quill, Tantivy interoperability, full, and the combined feature set.

The binary lock retains FrankenSQLite 0.3.17. Upstream published compatible
0.3.18 after the dependency freeze; the fresh public consumer resolves and
passes with that patch and Asupersync 0.4.10. The ops crate remains experimental.

## [v1.9.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/v1.9.0) -- 2026-09-07

Compare: <https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/compare/v1.8.0...v1.9.0>

- **FrankenSQLite 0.3.17.** All 20 database packages move together from 0.3.8;
  storage, durability, fsfs, and ops require the updated family. The release
  includes upstream fixes for prepared-read transaction release, cross-process
  WAL visibility, FTS5 maintenance, and savepoints. Native builds now require
  the C/assembler driver used by the upstream `stacker` / `psm` dependency.
- **Native quality inference is available explicitly.** Install
  `all-minilm-l6-v2-native` with `fsfs download-models`, then select
  `indexing.quality_model = "all-MiniLM-L6-v2-native"`. Its F32 producer runs on
  a caller-owned blocking pool, checks its output certificate before exposing
  an identity, and uses that identity for index, cache, and daemon admission.
  Native artifact loads now reuse an unchanged verified installation receipt
  for the exact registered producer. Missing, stale, foreign, and malformed
  receipts still require full artifact verification. The existing 500 ms
  native refinement test still times out with the stock debug binary; release
  executables have a separate documented validation lane. ONNX remains the
  default quality backend; the complete native migration is still open.
- **Search policies reach the product.** Quality weighting and bounded
  refinement apply to in-process and daemon searches. Timeout preserves Initial
  results while the owned worker finishes. Native cross-encoder reranking is
  wired through `fsfs search --rerank`, with cache keys bound to the selected
  reranker. Quality retrieval can discover candidates outside the fast pool.
- **Watch recovery retains work.** Failed vector jobs remain queued, and a
  restart replays the startup scan. JSON output and explicit fast-only requests
  follow the effective search policy; default document catalogs are scoped to
  the index root.
- **Crate bundle candidate:** facade 0.4.3; core/index/lexical/fusion 0.2.4;
  embed 0.2.5; rerank 0.2.6; storage/durability/quill 0.2.3; tui/ops 0.2.0;
  fsfs 1.9.1. Publication is pending validation. The publish contract and
  fresh-process logging receipts bind the audited Asupersync 0.4.10 identity
  and FrankenSQLite 0.3.17 family.

- **Quill reclaims merge-retired segment files under a busy writer; `QuillIndex::collect_garbage`; frankensearch 0.4.3 / frankensearch-quill 0.2.3** ([cass#453](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/coding_agent_session_search/issues/453)). A folded segment became collectable only after *three* clocks had run: its own mtime, its retirement receipt (`seg-<id>.fslx.retired`, stamped by the publication that dropped it from both MANIFEST slots), and a manifest-level floor measured from the **latest** publication. That third clock reset on every publish, so an embedder that publishes more often than the 300 s grace never reclaimed anything: a cass archive accumulated 1,642 folded inputs (4.2 GB) behind one live segment across back-to-back incremental runs, and only a run that happened to start >300 s after the previous publish ever swept them. The floor was redundant for receipted segments: the receipt is made durable *before* the slot renames that complete the retirement, so it strictly precedes the last instant any reader could have obtained a referencing MANIFEST through either slot, and grace measured from it already gives every such reader the full window (a segment a reader has mapped survives its unlink). `sweep_garbage_directory` now ages a receipted segment from its receipt alone; the manifest-level floor still gates the pre-supersession case where no receipt can exist. `KeeperWriter::collect_garbage` is exposed through `QuillIndex::collect_garbage` so a long-lived or frequently publishing writer can sweep without reopening. Tests: `later_publications_do_not_postpone_a_receipted_retirement` (replaces the test that pinned the reset), `retired_merge_inputs_are_reclaimed_while_an_older_reader_keeps_working` (a reader on the pre-merge generation keeps answering from its mapped inputs after the sweep unlinks them), `interrupted_sweep_leaves_only_a_stale_receipt_that_the_next_sweep_reclaims`. The gauntlet's built-in engine profile receipt moves to v5 for the quill 0.2.3 pin (v4 stays archive-valid).

- **`frankensearch-index` compiles for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` again** ([#42](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/issues/42), [`ef9fbf2f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/ef9fbf2f)). The generation-root work merged between v1.7.0 and v1.8.0 failed `cargo check` for the MSVC target with ten name/type-resolution errors: a `use std::os::unix::ffi::OsStrExt` sitting inside `check_closure` with no `cfg` around it, `GenerationRootError::with_raw_os_error` gated to Linux/macOS while the platform-independent authority publisher calls it, and the fallback `platform` module missing `write_lock_range`, `write_control_range` and `read_lock_image` — three entry points that same portable code names — plus an unimported `GenerationRootEntry` in its `inventory` signature. The closure check now uses the portable `OsStr::as_encoded_bytes` (byte-identical to the Unix view, and every use is a whole-string or ASCII-suffix comparison), `with_raw_os_error` is ungated, and the fallback module carries the three missing stubs, which are provably unreachable because its handle types are uninhabited. Generation roots remain a Linux/macOS feature: off those platforms every entry point still fails closed with `GenerationRootErrorKind::UnsupportedPlatform`, and that degradation is now documented in `AGENTS.md`. `scripts/quality-gate.sh` grows a `cross` stage — `cargo check -p frankensearch-index --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`, which needs only the target's `std`, never a Windows host or a linker — so the class of regression is caught from any dev host (`QUALITY_GATE_CROSS_TARGET` picks another triple; `QUALITY_GATE_ALLOW_CROSS_SKIP=1` downgrades a missing `std` to a SKIP).
- **The query daemon answers ~4x sooner; the product envelope is receipted** (bd-8j5dc, bridge Gap #3 product half). `crates/frankensearch-fsfs/tests/fsfs_latency_receipt.rs` (opt-in, `FRANKENSEARCH_PERF_RECEIPT=1`, release) drives the real `fsfs` binary with the registered models over the same 1,000-file corpus: `fsfs index` end to end, three cold `--no-daemon` searches, a `:ready` handshake floor, 50 one-request-per-connection daemon queries and 20 reranked ones, all with client wall times, phases, cache hits and the model/host/binary fingerprints; the gate's `perf` stage runs it after the library lane and writes `docs/evidence/perf/fsfs-latency-<date>-<host>.json`. The first run exposed a fixed cost: the daemon's accept loop slept a flat 50 ms whenever no connection was pending, so a query arriving right after the previous one waited out that sleep (p50 50.3 ms, p99 52.8 ms for a 5 ms search). The accept poll is now adaptive, 1 ms for two seconds after the last accepted connection and 50 ms when idle; the committed receipt measures daemon-served `fsfs search` at p50 12.7 ms / p95 13.9 ms / p99 14.8 ms (`:ready` round trip 1.1 ms), `--rerank` through the daemon at p50 233 ms, `fsfs index` at 14.1 s for 1,000 files (26.9 MB), and cold start at 3.3 s. The README envelope cites these rows as *product receipt*. The lane also measures watch mode (bd-thic0, bridge Gap #28): the watcher now logs one `fsfs watch batch applied` line per applied batch with `oldest_event_age_ms` (event observed to batch applied) and `apply_ms`; the receipt writes 20 files one at a time into a watched corpus and reads those lines: event-to-applied p50 725 ms, p95 848 ms (the 500 ms debounce plus p50 224 ms ingest into both tiers), all 20 files searchable from a fresh process after the watcher's graceful exit. Host-pressure sampling is pinned for that section because a saturated host pauses the watcher by design, and the receipt records the pin.
- **Measured latency and index-cost envelope** (bd-8s0nf, bridge Gap #3). `frankensearch/tests/latency_receipt.rs` is an opt-in (`FRANKENSEARCH_PERF_RECEIPT=1`) release-profile lane: a deterministic 1,000-document prose corpus is indexed through `IndexBuilder` with the registered potion + MiniLM stack and the Quill arm, then 50 timed hybrid `TwoTierSearcher` queries report p50/p95/p99 for the INITIAL yield, the phase-2 work and the refined delivery, per-stage timings, phase-2 skips with their reason, index wall/embed/lexical time, artifact sizes, RSS, and host, git and test-binary fingerprints. `FRANKENSEARCH_PERF_RECEIPT_MAX_REFINED_P95_MS` turns it into a threshold check (verified to fail on a planted bound). The gate gains an opt-in `perf` stage that runs it and writes `docs/evidence/perf/library-two-tier-latency-<date>-<host>.json`; the first receipt is committed and the README envelope now cites it: on this host the library delivers INITIAL at p50 0.40 ms and REFINED at p50 5.5 ms / p99 7.8 ms (40 of 50 queries refined; 10 short-keyword queries were answered by the lexical arm), MiniLM embeds a short query in ~5 ms, and indexing 1,000 documents with both tiers costs 17 s, against the README's previous `< 15 ms` / `~150 ms` / `~130 ms` targets. A second receipt at 10,000 documents (`FRANKENSEARCH_PERF_RECEIPT_DOCS=10000`, `library-two-tier-latency-10k-20260903-thinkstation1.json`) puts the fast-tier vector search at p50 0.29 ms, INITIAL at p50 1.0 ms and REFINED delivery at p50 7.6 ms / p99 11.0 ms, with indexing at 190 s (16.8 ms per document for both tiers), so the 10K row is measured rather than a target.
- **Library two-tier proven with the real models; the facade's tests run in the gate** (bd-9sxov, bridge Gap #12). `frankensearch/tests/integration.rs` gains `real_models_two_tier_search_yields_refined_through_the_public_api`: `IndexBuilder` with the auto-detected stack from the registered cache (potion fast tier + MiniLM quality tier, the models `fsfs` ships) writes both tiers and `TwoTierSearcher` yields INITIAL then REFINED with the quality tier searched and the relevant document in the head; it skips with a message when no full semantic stack is installed and `FRANKENSEARCH_REQUIRE_SEMANTIC_E2E=1` turns that skip into a failure. `scripts/quality-gate.sh` gains a `facade` stage (`cargo test -p frankensearch --tests --features hybrid`, 142 tests, the real-model lane required when the registered models are present) in the default stage list, and an opt-in `examples` stage that runs `frankensearch/examples/run_all.sh`; until now the library crate's integration tests were executed by nothing. The fusion sync/async parity test compares `phase2_vectors_searched` exactly instead of as a boolean.
- **Cross-encoder rerank stage in the product** (bd-7as5x, bridge Gap #8). `fsfs search --rerank` (config `search.rerank`, env `FRANKENSEARCH_RERANK`) re-scores the REFINED head with the pure-Rust frankentorch cross-encoder (`ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`, int8 BERT) and reorders it; the payload gains a `rerank` block (`status`, `reason_code`, `candidate_budget`, `reranked_hits`, `elapsed_ms`, `model`, per-hit `scores`) and `fsfs explain` prints the reranker score. The stage runs only on request: the model is loaded once per process and shared by the query daemon (the request carries the client's `rerank`, and the daemon's hot cache keys on it). Without a verified model the search keeps its fused order and reports `query.stage.rerank.disabled.unavailable`; a fast-only search reports `query.stage.rerank.disabled.no_quality` on the INITIAL phase it returns. The `ms-marco-minilm-l-6-v2` manifest now provisions `model.safetensors` (90.9 MB, pinned commit `c5ee24cb`) beside the ONNX export, so `fsfs download-models ms-marco-minilm-l-6-v2` installs everything the native backend needs; the reranker crate's real-model tests resolve that cache (or `FRANKENSEARCH_RERANK_MODEL_DIR`) instead of a macOS-only fixture path and pass on Linux against the parity reference. fsfs cargo feature `rerank` (default on) carries the dependency.
- **One catalog per index root** (bd-3tym7). `storage.db_path` now defaults to `{index_dir}/catalog.db`, the leading token standing for the resolved index root, instead of one global `~/.local/share/fsfs/fsfs.db`. The catalog is keyed by relative document path, so with a shared catalog a file already seen under another project counted as "unchanged" and watch mode wrote no vectors for it in a second root. `~/...` and absolute paths keep a shared catalog as an explicit choice; every consumer (watch ingest, status, doctor probes, tombstone cleanup, disk budget) resolves the path the same way. **Behaviour change:** an existing global catalog is no longer read; the first watch batch under a root simply ingests changed files as new.

## [1.8.0] -- 2026-09-02

Compare: <https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/compare/v1.7.0...v1.8.0>

fsfs 1.8.0 (library line unchanged at `frankensearch 0.4.2`). Release commit 66341808; `scripts/quality-gate.sh` passed 7/7 on it (fmt, check, clippy `-D warnings`, workspace lib tests, fsfs test binaries, real-model e2e, executable quick-start) on 2026-09-02T09:26Z. Assets: `fsfs-lite-1.8.0-{x86_64,aarch64}-unknown-linux-musl`, `fsfs-lite-1.8.0-{x86_64,aarch64}-apple-darwin`, `fsfs-1.8.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, `fsfs-1.8.0-aarch64-apple-darwin` (each `.tar.xz` + `.sha256`) and `SHA256SUMS`.

### Two-tier product, daemon lifetime, mutation parity, and the dsr gate (2026-09-01 .. 2026-09-02)

Landed on `main` from the 2026-09-01 reality check ([`docs/evidence/reality-check-20260901.md`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/blob/main/docs/evidence/reality-check-20260901.md)) and its bridge plan ([`docs/planning/BRIDGE_PLAN_2026-09-02.md`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/blob/main/docs/planning/BRIDGE_PLAN_2026-09-02.md)):

- **fsfs is the two-tier product the README describes.** `fsfs index` now builds the quality-tier generation (`vector/quality.fsvi`, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-d) next to the fast tier (potion-multilingual-128M, 256-d) under the same publication lease, and search emits INITIAL then REFINED: `query.stream.initial_ready` / `query.stream.refined_ready` on the stream, and the typed planner reason `query.stage.quality.disabled.unavailable` when a generation carries no quality tier ([`d9a53ce0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/d9a53ce0), [`aefa607f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/aefa607f)). `status` and `doctor` report both generations (`quality_generation_id`, `quality_generation_dimension`). **Behaviour change:** index time includes the MiniLM pass. Fast-only indexing/search is selected by the `strict` pressure profile (`FRANKENSEARCH_PRESSURE_PROFILE=strict`); `--fast-only` and `FRANKENSEARCH_FAST_ONLY` are rejected under the default `performance` profile, and that rejection is now printed on stderr at the command that asked for it instead of surfacing only under `fsfs config` ([`31903318`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/31903318); README corrected in [`e820b486`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/e820b486); whether the flag should override the profile stays open as bd-k7x34).
- **Query daemon lifetime.** `fsfs search --daemon` / `serve --daemon` detach with `setsid` and no longer die with the shell that spawned them (the parent-death signal is gone); `--idle-timeout-ms` (default 600000, `0` keeps it persistent) exits an idle daemon; search loads only the fast tier eagerly and the quality tier lazily ([`2635f1f8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/2635f1f8)).
- **One-shot mutations reach every arm.** `append-batch` writes appended documents into the Quill lexical generation (BM25 rank, `in_both_sources`) as well as both vector tiers; `delete` tombstones the lexical arm and both vector tiers; `delete --prefix` scans WAL-only documents ([`367f894a`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/367f894a), [`b8f841d7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/b8f841d7); lexical append/delete [`5d228943`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/5d228943), bd-a2hct). Two follow-through fixes in [`e820b486`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/e820b486): a one-shot mutation now **commits** the Quill generation (a flush alone leaves the documents in the accumulator, invisible to readers), and every in-place mutation (`append-batch`, `delete`, `compact`, the compaction daemon) first asks a live query daemon to exit over its socket and retries the writer open, because the now long-lived daemon held the FSVI map lock and refused mutations for up to its idle timeout after any search.
- **Compaction daemon control.** `fsfs daemon` publishes `daemon.pid` under the index root; `fsfs daemon --stop` sends SIGTERM and waits for the exit (a stale pid file is cleared); `--idle-timeout-ms` exits after a quiet period; the help text names the real `--poll-ms` flag ([`5d228943`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/5d228943)).
- **`explain` accepts what search prints.** `fsfs explain <rank|R-id|path>` resolves the 1-based rank or a path from the last search, not only the `R0` session ids that no output format prints; BM25 `tf`/`idf` placeholders are flagged with the new `bm25_stats_unavailable` warning instead of posing as measurements ([`31903318`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/31903318), bd-iw2w9).
- **`status` stops counting a global catalog as index bytes.** `metadata_bytes` and `size_bytes` cover the index root only; `catalog_path` / `catalog_bytes` report the catalog wherever it lives, so an empty index directory reports zero bytes ([`31903318`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/31903318), bd-f8j9z).
- **Vector compaction no longer warns about the WAL it just merged.** `rewrite_index` reloaded the new generation while the superseded sidecar was still on disk, so every `fsfs index` printed `discarding stale/mismatched WAL entries` for data that was already durable; the sidecar is now removed before the reload ([`5d228943`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/5d228943), bd-k1vcc).
- **Both vector generations get RaptorQ protection like Quill segments** (bd-9ekrw). `frankensearch-durability`'s `FsviProtector` had no consumer; `fsfs index` now writes `vector/index.fsvi.fec` and `vector/quality.fsvi.fec` under the publication lease, `fsfs compact` and the compaction daemon refresh them after every rewrite, and `fsfs compact` restores a generation from its sidecar before merging when the bytes drifted (unrepairable damage is a typed `IndexCorrupted` error). In-place tombstones (`delete`, watch-mode deletes) remove the sidecar instead of leaving one that would resurrect the record; `fsfs doctor` reports `durability.vector_sidecars` as intact / unprotected / corrupted. Pinned by a unit test that protects, flips a byte, sees the corruption, repairs it byte-for-byte, and sees the tombstone invalidation.
- **`frankensearch-index` compiles for x86_64 macOS again.** The generation-root host checks (a1990de7) gated their macOS platform helpers on `aarch64` while their callers were unconditional, so the `x86_64-apple-darwin` lite asset could not be built; the gates now cover all of macOS, in the source and in the manifest's target-specific `rustix` dependency (the arm64 and x86_64 branches use the same calls; the arm64-host-only test modules keep their gate).
- **A stale RaptorQ sidecar can never restore old bytes.** The index crate now drops `<fsvi>.fec` whenever the main file's bytes change (compaction, vacuum, `finish`, in-place tombstones); a watcher's shutdown compaction had left the one-shot sidecar in place, and the next `fsfs compact` would have "repaired" the merged generation back to its pre-compaction contents. Publishers re-protect after they finish writing, so a generation is either protected for its exact bytes or reported as unprotected by `doctor`.
- **Watch mode feeds the quality tier** (bd-orb50). With a storage catalog configured (the default), a watched create or update enqueued only the fast-tier embedding job and the quality tier fell behind (`doctor`: "the tiers have diverged"), so REFINED never ranked the new content; the quality vector is now written inline on the same batch, as the direct path always did. Pre-existing in v1.7.0.
- **Watch mode's search limit is now stated.** While `fsfs index --watch` runs, the watcher holds the vector generations' exclusive writer lock, so `fsfs search` from another process and the query daemon are refused with `fsvi.map_lock` until it stops (unchanged since the map lock landed; v1.7.0 behaves the same); files are ingested and become searchable the moment the watcher exits. README says so; the lock-free design (WAL tombstones so a published generation is immutable) is bd-z2nfa.
- **Watch mode waits for its writer lock instead of dying at startup** (bd-ql03m). `fsfs index --watch` opens the vector generations' writer seconds after the same process published them, and an intermittent `fsvi.map_lock` refusal (reproduced 5/6 in plain runs, absent under tracing, gone after 30 s) killed the watcher right after the summary line. The live pipeline now waits up to 30 s, logging the wait; the index crate gained map-lock lifecycle tracing (`RUST_LOG=frankensearch_index::map_lock=debug`) so the holder can be named the next time it is seen. Root cause still open on the bead.
- **In-place tombstones are visible to generation fingerprints on every filesystem.** A main-generation `soft_delete` writes flags through the shared FSVI mapping; on tmpfs a write to an already-dirty page never bumps mtime/ctime, so the metadata fingerprint that retained search resources (the query daemon) rebind on said "same generation" and kept serving tombstoned records. The index now touches the file's timestamp after such writes; pinned by an index-crate test and by the fsfs rebind test under a tmpfs temp dir.
- **`fsfs update` verification survives `ETXTBSY`.** Executing the just-written binary retries for up to 500ms on `ExecutableFileBusy` (a sibling fork still holding the write descriptor) at both the update and rollback sites ([`5f5b0c40`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/5f5b0c40) for the test fixture; production sites in [`5d228943`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/5d228943), with unit tests that hold the image open for writing).
- **One quality gate, run through dsr.** `scripts/quality-gate.sh` (fmt, check, clippy `-D warnings`, lib tests, fsfs tests, real-model e2e, quick-start) is the whole gate and runs on real hosts via `dsr quality --tool frankensearch`; there is no GitHub Actions lane ([`aefa607f`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/aefa607f), 7/7 receipt in [`fba1a8f4`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/fba1a8f4)).
- **Docs truth pass and small fixes.** Precedence, publish lane, model bundling, rerank status, the `unsafe` policy, and the crate map in README/AGENTS now match the code ([`5d14c8f7`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/5d14c8f7)); `search --help` is a help request, not a query ([`c840926c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/c840926c)); beads comment-id collisions repaired and the Quill-by-default ruling recorded ([`d8336095`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/d8336095)).

### Opt-in multilingual native embeddings and crates.io patch release (2026-08-28, gh#40)

- `frankensearch 0.4.2` adds the distinct `paraphrase-multilingual-minilm-l12-v2` embedding space, backed by its real XLM-R Unigram tokenizer and all 12 Frankentorch encoder layers. The immutable manifest pins the upstream revision and exact checksums for weights, tokenizer, configuration, and tokenizer metadata; acquisition remains explicit and the model is never auto-selected.
- The multilingual model deliberately does not reuse the existing `minilm-384` identity despite sharing its 384-dimensional geometry. Loaders and persisted identity checks fail closed across the two spaces, and operators must fully backfill then atomically publish a new semantic generation when switching.
- Frozen-model proof covers Chinese-to-English and English-to-Chinese retrieval, mixed source-code/text input, bit-exact repeat inference, topology/tokenizer attestation, latency, and bounded peak memory. The native weight loader now discovers contiguous encoder depth and transfers large tensors into inference sessions without retaining avoidable duplicate buffers.
- The changed crates advance to `frankensearch-embed 0.2.4`, `frankensearch-rerank 0.2.5`, and the `frankensearch 0.4.2` facade. Unchanged members retain their existing published versions, avoiding unrelated semver and durable-format churn.

### Windows Quill writer admission and crates.io patch release (2026-08-27, gh#39)

- `frankensearch-quill 0.2.2` and the `frankensearch 0.4.1` facade add native Windows writer admission using the standard library's OS-backed exclusive file lock. Retained no-delete, no-follow handles bind the admitted directory and `LOCK` path to stable Windows file identities; contention remains a typed busy result, while unsafe lock artifacts and identity drift fail as corruption.
- The unchanged facade dependencies receive provenance-only patch bumps from this exact release source: `frankensearch-core 0.2.3`, `frankensearch-durability 0.2.2`, `frankensearch-embed 0.2.3`, `frankensearch-fusion 0.2.3`, `frankensearch-index 0.2.3`, `frankensearch-lexical 0.2.3`, `frankensearch-rerank 0.2.4`, and `frankensearch-storage 0.2.2`. This keeps the ten-crate facade publication closure content-addressed instead of reusing versions already occupied by the older `0.4.0` source commit; only Quill and the facade contain behavioral changes.
- Windows generation claims use exclusive creation, and segment, MANIFEST, durability-sidecar, recovery, and `CURRENT` publication use write-through atomic moves. Native tests exercise cross-process acquire/busy/release/reuse, lock replacement/non-file refusal, and the real writer create -> publish -> reopen path.
- Descriptor-relative garbage collection remains explicitly unavailable on Windows. Writer open logs that typed non-claim instead of manufacturing an empty successful sweep; the Unix GC implementation is unchanged.

### crates.io publication of the library line (2026-08-24, gh#416)

The whole current library line is on crates.io for the first time, published bottom-up with every crate at a fresh, never-used version (registry 0.3.2 / 0.2.x entries from the earlier attempt were stale same-version twins of older trees and are superseded, never overwritten):

- `frankensearch 0.4.0` (facade; 0.3.x is skipped so resolution can never land on the stale 0.3.2 twin), `frankensearch-core 0.2.2`, `frankensearch-embed 0.2.2`, `frankensearch-index 0.2.2`, `frankensearch-lexical 0.2.2`, `frankensearch-fusion 0.2.2`, `frankensearch-rerank 0.2.3`, `frankensearch-storage 0.2.1`, `frankensearch-durability 0.2.1`, `frankensearch-quill 0.2.1` (first release under this name).
- Every git dependency was retargeted to the registry to make this possible: the frankentorch family is consumed as `frankentorch-{core,kernel-cpu,dispatch,autograd,runtime,api}` (published under those names; crates.io `ft-api` belongs to an unrelated crate), the HNSW fork is `frankenhnsw 0.3.5` (fork of upstream `hnsw_rs` 0.3.4 with layer-invariant and hnswio-hardening fixes; upstream import path kept via `package =`), and tantivy is registry `=0.26.1` — its `lru ^0.16.3` carries informational RUSTSEC-2026-0253, unreachable in this graph because the advisory needs a panicking `Drop` on a cache key under `catch_unwind` and tantivy's cache keys are trivially droppable. Move to tantivy 0.27 when it ships with patched lru.
- The version bump moves `frankensearch-embed`'s frozen model-manifest fingerprints (they embed `CARGO_PKG_VERSION` in `implementation_revision`); the fixture test tracks the new values.
- The `four_engine_generation_receipts` facade gates, red from birth, were repaired: a sealed FSVI v2 image stores records sorted by `(doc_id_hash, doc_id)`, so the ordered docset every role attests is the image's stored order, not the writer's insertion order — the tests now derive `generation_order()` from the admitted image and feed the same sequence to every role, including Quill's indexing order.

## [1.7.0] -- 2026-08-23

Compare: <https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/compare/v1.6.0...v1.7.0>

fsfs 1.7.0. About 125 non-merge commits after the v1.6.0 tag.

### Delivered capability

- Every direct dependency sits at its crates.io latest: FrankenSQLite 0.3.8, Asupersync 0.4.9, fastembed 6.0.0, jsonschema 0.50 (see below).
- Hash-control ranks stay off semantic fields through fuse/persist/explain/dashboard.
- Quill schema-general CASS ingest path with conversation-scoped identity.
- `UPGRADE_LOG.md` relocated to `docs/planning/`; skill-loop scratch untracked.

### Dependency refresh (2026-08-21)

- FrankenSQLite family 0.3.1 → 0.3.8 across storage / durability / fsfs / ops ([`8382ec3e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/8382ec3e), [`4d701c40`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/4d701c40)). Brings the GH#366 `ReservedEmpty` reopen fix, GH#370 orphaned FTS5 `%_content` reclaim, GH#371 bounded WITHOUT-ROWID teardown, and GH#244 attached-schema transaction writes. All 20 `fsqlite*` lock entries move together. 0.3.6 and 0.3.7 were skipped for release: their `fsqlite-ext-json` enabled serde_json `arbitrary_precision`, a feature Cargo unifies workspace-wide that breaks `f64` fields in tagged serde types (167 reds here; frankensqlite GH#375); 0.3.8 gates it behind an opt-in.
- Asupersync 0.4.5 → 0.4.9 in lockstep with `franken-kernel` / `franken-decision` / `franken-evidence`; the fresh-process contract pin now binds `asupersync@0.4.9` ([`4d701c40`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/4d701c40)).
- fastembed `=5.17.4` → `=6.0.0` on the rustls ORT path; the only upstream break (typed `fastembed::Error`) needs no call-site change ([`57650434`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/57650434)).
- jsonschema 0.49 → 0.50 in quill-gauntlet and fsfs ([`b32a1087`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/b32a1087)).
- Thirty semver-compatible transitive bumps via `cargo update`. Details: [`docs/planning/UPGRADE_LOG.md`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/blob/main/docs/planning/UPGRADE_LOG.md).

### Closed workstreams

### Hash-control fusion continues past v1.6.0

v1.6.0 stopped presenting hash/FNV/JL generations as semantic search. The follow-on window keeps hash ranks off semantic fields through fuse, persist, explain, and dashboard, and routes hash-control search through lane-aware fuse APIs.

- Hash-control ranks remapped at the RRF fuse boundary ([`00b6452a986f264fcca46c0bfa0588d703dc0202`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/00b6452a986f264fcca46c0bfa0588d703dc0202)); hash-control search routed through lane-aware fuse APIs ([`b1e6409645a079c277b1fb5e26e52402cde28203`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/b1e6409645a079c277b1fb5e26e52402cde28203)).
- Fused lexical-only and hash-only hits are no longer tagged `Hybrid` ([`03e9431d690440233040ccb3b64ef3bd5589d255`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/03e9431d690440233040ccb3b64ef3bd5589d255)).

### Quill CASS schema-general ingest

- Durable create/open bound to an explicit compiled schema ([`1d0dd64c4e7d0bb56ba4bd2a80bcb9e922fb3aff`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/1d0dd64c4e7d0bb56ba4bd2a80bcb9e922fb3aff)).
- Native CASS ingest surface with a Quill-only schema generation ([`6fd85d8022cc9089c5d2e2e81e849db5b5590aa5`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/6fd85d8022cc9089c5d2e2e81e849db5b5590aa5)); `conversation_id` stored as 8 LE bytes and `CassDocument` projected onto `SchemaDocument` ([`869ba30572c39915cfa53b0cb0e962f2587be44e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/869ba30572c39915cfa53b0cb0e962f2587be44e)).
- Document identity is conversation-scoped, not `source#ordinal` ([`400eabef73bdde38f2058ff03d205e56b3fbb026`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/400eabef73bdde38f2058ff03d205e56b3fbb026)).
- Differential Quill CASS path against the Tantivy incumbent ([`6d899a6f9510ced8a55878c58edf735c410ece88`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/6d899a6f9510ced8a55878c58edf735c410ece88)); dev-only Quill-vs-Tantivy equivalence comparator behind `cass-equivalence` ([`8db4589ee12b529e35898aa644eff8c9dc88e831`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/8db4589ee12b529e35898aa644eff8c9dc88e831)).

### Cancel, transients, and ANN

- Observe cancel before FastEmbed ONNX work ([`572548eada5ef1534045f59bb61aecaa7b39f02e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/572548eada5ef1534045f59bb61aecaa7b39f02e)).
- Lockstep asupersync 0.4.4 and retry FrankenSQLite transients ([`ad0326ed055503bff4e6e9e1c8423007fd7ef790`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/ad0326ed055503bff4e6e9e1c8423007fd7ef790)); asupersync 0.4.4 → 0.4.5 ([`160a7dc750aa46c4325ee3b20551f2de1c189ad3`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/160a7dc750aa46c4325ee3b20551f2de1c189ad3)).
- Admit HNSW graphs that are weakly connected but not fully directed-reachable ([#32](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/issues/32), [`766f45a011ad773df38c3d8079c15f90e1cdcf5b`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/766f45a011ad773df38c3d8079c15f90e1cdcf5b)).

## [v1.6.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0) -- 2026-08-14

Product CLI `fsfs` 1.6.0. Crate versions stay decoupled (workspace members 0.2.x, facade 0.3.2). 481 commits since v1.5.0.

### Hash control is no longer presented as semantic search

Hash / FNV / JL vector generations are labeled as control artifacts everywhere an operator or agent can read them: doctor, status, dashboards, search JSON (`skip_reason`, `vector_generation_id`, `vector_generation_is_hash`), table/CSV/explain ranks (`[L H]`, `hash_rank`), stream start, and degradation advice (`degrade.advice.hash_control`).

- `auto_detect` / `require_semantic` no longer classify a two-hash stack as `Full`.
- `IndexBuilder` will not write a quality FSVI from a hash embedder.
- `TwoTierSearcher` will not refine quality from hash-control ranks.
- Full search with a hash FSVI and a lexical index continues as lexical plus typed hash-control advice; it does not pretend to be semantic. Full search with no vector index still fails closed (`IndexNotFound`).
- FrankenSQLite edges are lockstep on crates.io **0.3.1** (same 0.3 API: autocommit durability, concurrent-open prepare, freelist safety).

### Storage schema

Current storage `SCHEMA_VERSION` is **7** (FTS5 rebuild-version marker). Fresh databases still bootstrap directly to latest; historical v1–v6 fixtures migrate.

### Not in this release

- Mach-O ArtifactStore F1 (needs Darwin/unsafe).
- Live 50k/100k `--full` corpus numbers were not re-run for this tag.
- Windows assets remain absent (same as v1.5.0: no Windows build host).
- GitHub Actions is not used; binaries are produced with dsr.

## [v1.5.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/v1.5.0) -- 2026-08-05 (GitHub Release)

Compare: <https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/compare/v1.4.3...v1.5.0>

728 non-merge commits since v1.4.3. Remedy for [#31](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/issues/31): since v1.2.5 the pipeline shipped only `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`, so `fsfs update` advertised a new version and then 404'd on every other platform. This release ships an asset for every target triple the self-updater and installer construct (except Windows — the build host ran out of disk).

- `st_nlink` widened to `u64` for musl portability ([`9966b6d876b6926631a97ae6c0323444d090c8bb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/9966b6d876b6926631a97ae6c0323444d090c8bb)).
- `frankensearch-fsfs` package version bumped to 1.5.0 ([`6c1140aa04f6ca1dcdf427edbf93f41082a999ff`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/6c1140aa04f6ca1dcdf427edbf93f41082a999ff)).
- Library API sweep in this window (`LexicalRead` / `LexicalWrite` replacing combined `LexicalSearch`) is breaking for library consumers — hence the minor bump.

## [v1.4.3](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/v1.4.3) -- 2026-08-02 (GitHub Release)

Compare: <https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/compare/v1.4.2...v1.4.3>

First complete GitHub Release since v1.2.5. Native Quill lexical engine in fsfs (no more writer-lock failures on concurrent searches); `fsfs index` terminates cleanly; loader-capable stock default; typed embedding-identity foundation; working Linux self-update (the updater previously requested a nonexistent asset name).

- Self-update requests the lite asset family on lite-only targets ([`a5f464432f7514d54f4e43b31a839b9536ac22f0`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/a5f464432f7514d54f4e43b31a839b9536ac22f0)).
- Release bump that must carry the self-update asset-family fix ([`4446f75bc6978dd65e4ef4cf0d27d578ba4ebbd8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/4446f75bc6978dd65e4ef4cf0d27d578ba4ebbd8)).

### Post-publication scope correction — 2026-07-30

- **Native ANN scope:** v1.4.0 landed the in-tree native HNSW engine and its
  FSVI-bound graph and receipt foundations, but it has not yet replaced the
  shipping ANN path. `TwoTierIndex` and the `ann` feature still use the
  git-pinned `hnsw_rs` adapter; native production wiring, tombstone handling,
  and external-dependency removal remain follow-up work.
- **Embedding-integrity scope:** v1.4.0 landed canonical identity types,
  remote-vector attestation, zero-signal classification, sink-level
  validation, and FSVI v2 admission foundations. Enforcement is not yet
  end-to-end: fusion and fsfs still contain raw-vector and
  model-ID/dimension-only seams, current production writers still emit legacy
  FSVI v1, and generic auto-detection can return an explicitly degraded
  `HashOnly` stack. “Fail closed” therefore describes the implemented trust
  boundaries, not every production ingest and search boundary.

### Quill: Native Pure-Rust Lexical Engine (new crate `frankensearch-quill`)

The dominant workstream of the epoch: a ground-up, memory-safe BM25 lexical
engine built to replace Tantivy inside frankensearch (design doc:
`COMPREHENSIVE_PLAN_FOR_THE_QUILL_LEXICAL_ENGINE.md`). Epics E0–E5 of the
`bd-quill-*` family are closed (89 closed issues in the quill epic family);
E6 (gauntlet at scale), E7 (default flip), E8 (perf doctrine), and E9 (Tantivy
retirement) remain open — Quill is the recommended `quill` feature path, while
Tantivy stays in-tree behind `lexical-tantivy` as the pinned conformance oracle.

- `fastembed-reranker` remains available as an optional feature for the previous FlashRank-style lane

### SIMD and Systems Performance Offensive

Hundreds of measured, bit-identity-gated optimizations across every crate,
recorded pass-over-pass in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md` with rejected hypotheses in
`docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md` (the ledger discipline itself is a deliverable of
this epoch: ~150+ negative-evidence entries prevent re-litigating dead ends).

- Runtime-dispatched AVX2/F16C kernel SELF-SPEEDUP maintenance versus the preceding frankensearch paths: f16 dot products 3.6–4.0x ([7239d585](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/7239d585e765a430e0acff5a573a6ddbaf12f936)), 4-bit slab pack 10.3–13.6x ([dc60d618](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/dc60d618c649e33d2d596abb44750b65f3ed3bad)), FSVI slab write 6.4–7.3x ([2a4d3334](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/2a4d333445b14e80f3d7d865516056b2619efbf5)), 384-dim specializations ([cb0bb785](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/cb0bb785771d1fae6a87d922f0c3bffb7ba9564e))

### fsfs Operability Wave (bd-pkl0 roadmap)

A May burst delivering the "agent-scale resilience and operability" roadmap
(epic `bd-pkl0`, closed with 15+ children), followed by lifecycle hardening.

- New diagnostic/ops surfaces: self-calibrating profile report ([0581b039](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/0581b03940ee9c04af03b06249908d3430a8648a)), index freshness audit ([7c82d27f](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/7c82d27f166bbc832ba395da426b6e6f4e421403)), resource pressure governor ([3c7cda27](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/3c7cda27e0b9ed053f959564f38434babb7970bd)), index footprint advisor ([ea64a0f0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/ea64a0f05a58dba761601b9435a6a5a577f81b55)), benchmark drift dashboard ([a4d3cec8](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/a4d3cec852a8cc862b531ca042742c012cfc460c)), corpus privacy preflight, model cache diagnostics, degraded incident suite, query-plan metamorphic suite

### Build & CI

- Decouple release CI builds from quality gate so tag pushes produce artifacts ([9b9accb](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/9b9accb51ea9c2c264aec428df886c91f71fc471))
- Exclude `tools/optimize_params` from default build; add `--recurse-submodules` to install.sh ([35becff](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/35becff5ceda7865e49f3c4923410a6bcb1c61e3))

## [v1.1.2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/v1.1.2) -- 2026-02-22

> **Fix version reporting, update mechanism, and TUI visibility** -- [Full diff from v1.1.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.2)
>
> Lightweight tag. Published as a GitHub Release.

### Release & Update Infrastructure

- Overhaul release asset system with proper Windows support and SHA256SUMS, refactor pipeline dedup logic ([7f4f8c7](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/7f4f8c732f0918adcf3a3ce974fa84bf78dbae6b))
- **Version reporting** -- binary now correctly reports its actual version instead of `v0.1.0`
- **Update mechanism** -- `fsfs update` constructs correct download URLs matching release asset naming (`fsfs-{version}-{triple}.{ext}`)
- **SHA256SUMS** -- update verification downloads the release-level checksum file instead of per-artifact sidecars
- **Windows target triple** -- correct detection for `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` and `aarch64-pc-windows-msvc`

### CLI & UX

- **TUI visibility** -- running `fsfs` with no args now prints diagnostic messages when the TUI exits
- Tighten root probe limits, expand excluded directories, and improve first-run UX ([3cdae25](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/3cdae25fa2e47360edab7bed9e9e6cd3fe07db1d))

### Performance & Correctness

- Use `HashSet` for O(1) duplicate `doc_id` detection in `TwoTierIndexBuilder` ([8cd272a](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/8cd272a9b714dfdf7ce5ad294d1095c3e24d9ce4))
- Use `BTreeSet` for deterministic path ordering in `PendingEvents` ([378af78](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/378af788b60319a1715cc56a9c3e069723a258e7))
- Populate actual index path in WAL `IndexCorrupted` error for better diagnostics ([b72bfd4](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/commit/b72bfd41e4b9088dedbc382f1ebb7252e797c54b))

## [v1.1.1](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/v1.1.1) -- 2026-02-22

> [Full diff from v1.1.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/compare/v1.1.0...v1.1.1)
>
> Lightweight tag pointing to the same commit as v1.1.0 (`82c18ff`). Published as a separate GitHub Release with patched release notes describing fixes that were folded into the v1.1.0 binary.

**Note:** v1.1.0 and v1.1.1 share the same commit. v1.1.1 was cut as a quick-follow release to document first-run fixes that shipped in the v1.1.0 binary but warranted explicit callout.

### Bug Fixes (documented retroactively)

- **Fix first-run hang on macOS** -- reduced filesystem probe budget (depth 2, 10K entries max) and excluded macOS system directories (`Library`, `Pictures`, `Movies`, etc.)
- **Add progress indicator** -- prints "Scanning for indexable directories..." before filesystem probe begins
- **SHA256SUMS filename** -- checksum file now has the correct name

## [v0.1.0](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/releases/tag/v0.1.0) -- 2026-02-19

> **Initial public release** -- [Full diff from initial commit](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankensearch/compare/42156796c494...v0.1.0)
>
> Annotated tag. Published as a GitHub Release.

The first public release of frankensearch -- a two-tier hybrid local search engine for Rust with the `fsfs` standalone CLI. This release includes the full workspace of 11 crates and approximately 240 commits over 6 days of intensive multi-agent development (2026-02-13 through 2026-02-19).

### Two-Tier Progressive Search Engine

- Fast initial results (<15 ms target) followed by quality-refined results (~150 ms target)
- Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) combining lexical BM25 and semantic vector similarity
- Configurable score blending between fast and quality tiers (`quality_weight`)
- Graceful degradation -- `SearchPhase::RefinementFailed` preserves Phase 1 results when quality tier errors or times out
- Deterministic ordering for reproducible ranking via stable tie-break logic
- Query classification (`identifier`, `short keyword`, `natural language`) with adaptive budgets
- Exclusion queries (`-term`) for filtering unwanted results
- Negation-aware canonicalization pipeline

### Embedding System

- Hash embedder (zero model downloads) for dev/CI
