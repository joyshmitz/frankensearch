# NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md — frankensearch perf swarm

> Honest ledger of perf experiments that **did NOT pay off** (≈0 gain or regression)
> and were therefore **reverted**. The point of this file is to stop future agents
> (and future me) from re-attempting dead ends. Every entry must cite the measured
> ratio vs. the pre-change baseline on the same workload.

Conventions:
- **Workload** = the exact bench id (`cargo bench` group/function) measured head-to-head.
- **Ratio** = new_time / old_time. `< 1.0` is a speedup, `> 1.0` is a regression.
- A lever is **reverted** if ratio ∈ [0.97, 1.03] (noise) or > 1.03 (regression).
- Wins (ratio < 0.97, kept) go in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`, not here.

Build/bench protocol (per-crate ONLY):
```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/<agent-lane> \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p <crate> --profile release
```

## Measurement blockers

| Date | Owner | Workload | Evidence | Status |
|------|-------|----------|----------|--------|
| 2026-06-27 | BlackThrush (`frankensearch-cod-a`) | `frankensearch/search_bench bold_verify_tantivy_class` clean hot-span retry | No checked bench worktree had commits ahead of `main` (`git rev-list --count main..HEAD` = 0). In isolated worktree `amberfield-lexical-trace-20260627`, added only the `FRANKENSEARCH_BOLD_VERIFY_SUMMARY_ONLY` harness gate so BOLD emits rows before Criterion's trace flood, then retried the prior two-attribute hot-span lever (`execute_query_with_offset` + `TantivyIndex::search_doc_ids`). Span-enabled baseline on `ovh-a` completed but emitted ~126k tokens of close-event tracing; hybrid ratios vs the Tantivy/Lucene/Meili-class proxy were still slower on important rows: 10k exact 1.074, 10k short 1.095, 10k quoted 1.050, `limit_all` 1.213, 100k short 1.046. The no-spans candidate on `vmi1227854` was mixed and cross-worker, with no accepted keep row: 10k quoted 1.164, `limit_all` 1.244, 100k exact 1.158, 100k natural-language 1.047, 100k short 1.000, 100k high-fanout 1.016, 100k zero-hit 1.000. A same-worker A/B attempt failed because the immediate post-baseline candidate rerun selected `vmi1264463` instead of `ovh-a` and was interrupted before measurement. Accepted Lucene/Tantivy/Meili-class ratio: none; source hunk reverted. | Landed only the summary-only BOLD harness switch plus this ledger entry. Agent Mail DB was corrupt, so no reservation/message could be recorded. |
| 2026-06-24 | BlueGull (`frankensearch-cod-a`) | `frankensearch/search_bench vector_search_topk/top10/10000` | `cargo bench --release -p frankensearch --bench search_bench vector_search_topk/top10/10000 -- --quiet` failed before measurement on rustc `1.98.0-nightly (f20a92ec0 2026-06-07)` because Cargo rejected `--release` for `cargo bench` as an unexpected argument. | Blocker tracked in `bd-ui41`; do not count as a perf ratio. |
| 2026-06-24 | BlueGull (`frankensearch-cod-a`) | `frankensearch/search_bench vector_search_topk/top10/10000` | Fallback optimized bench command without `--release` ran through RCH on `vmi1153651` but remained in cold compile/link with no Criterion timing output after more than 10 minutes; interrupted by the owner with exit 130. | No ratio produced; use `bd-ui41` to establish a reproducible harness and command contract. |
| 2026-06-24 | BlueGull (`frankensearch-cod-a`) | Tantivy/Lucene-class original comparison | README/AGENTS confirm frankensearch is a Tantivy BM25 + semantic/vector hybrid, but no current per-crate harness emits same-corpus ratios against a Tantivy-only incumbent. | Blocker tracked in `bd-ui41`; no dominance claim is valid until this exists. |
| 2026-06-24 | frankensearch-cod-b | `frankensearch/search_bench` requested protocol | `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-b rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch --release --bench search_bench -- --sample-size 10` selected RCH worker `ovh-a`, then Cargo rejected `--release` for `cargo bench` with `unexpected argument '--release' found`; `cargo bench --help` lists `--profile <PROFILE-NAME>` instead. | Same protocol blocker as above; successful measurement used `--profile release` and remains per-crate. |
| 2026-06-24 | frankensearch-cod-b | `frankensearch/search_bench vector_search_topk/top10/{1000,5000,10000}` | Same-worker RCH run on `ovh-a`: `rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch --profile release --bench search_bench -- --sample-size 10`. Results: 1K `944.07 us`, 5K `3.4640 ms`, 10K `1.6642 ms`. | Scaling order is unstable/noisy; use as routing evidence only, not as keep/reject proof. |
| 2026-06-24 | frankensearch-cod-b | `frankensearch-index/dot_product` release-profile comparison from detached baseline worktree | Three attempts with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-b rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --profile release --bench dot_product -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 3` fell open to local with `no admissible workers: insufficient_slots=8,health_below_fallback=2,hard_preflight=1`; each local fallback was interrupted before measurement. | No release-profile ratio. Bench-profile RCH runs may be routing evidence, but kept wins need an admitted remote release-profile run or an in-process head-to-head harness. |
| 2026-06-24 | BlueGull (`frankensearch-cod-a`) | `frankensearch-index/dot_product f32_bytes` vs Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class original | Kept microkernel proof is against the embedded pre-change frankensearch `f32_bytes_old` baseline: pinned RCH worker `vmi1149989` measured `dot/dim256/f32_bytes/10000` at 3.4835 ms old -> 0.66126 ms new (ratio 0.190) and `dot/dim384/f32_bytes/10000` at 5.1487 ms old -> 1.8811 ms new (ratio 0.365). There is still no same-corpus Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class comparator for this vector-byte kernel or end-to-end workload. | Original-comparator ratio remains blocked by `bd-ui41`; do not claim dominance over Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class from this microkernel win alone. |
| 2026-06-26 | BlackThrush | `frankensearch-index/dot_product f32_slice` vs Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class original | Kept microkernel proof is against the embedded pre-change frankensearch `f32_slice_old` baseline, not a search-engine incumbent: remote RCH worker `vmi1227854` measured `dot/dim256/f32_slice/10000` at 2.3594 ms old -> 750.64 us new (ratio **0.318**) and `dot/dim384/f32_slice/10000` at 3.7372 ms old -> 2.2784 ms new (ratio **0.610**) with `cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --profile release --bench dot_product f32_slice -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 3`. A same-command local fallback was mixed/noisy (dim256 **1.216x slower**, dim384 **0.935x faster**) and is not used for the keep decision. | Original-comparator ratio is not applicable for this vector microkernel.

A same-session BOLD comparator probe for `frankensearch` was started, produced excessive tracing output, and was cancelled via `rch cancel 29904571677541210` before a complete summary; it is not used for the keep decision. | Original-comparator ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is **N/A** for this isolated vector dot kernel.

Do not claim new Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class dominance from it; the residual BOLD rows still require direct comparator proof. |
| 2026-06-27 | BlackThrush (`frankensearch-cod-a`) | `frankensearch-index/fsvi_4bit_two_pass fourbit_mult5` vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class original | Kept FSVI pass-1 proof is against the immediately prior frankensearch file-backed 4-bit two-pass vector primitive, not a search-engine incumbent: `rch exec` had no admissible worker for the bench and fell back locally, then a freshness-forced candidate rebuild measured `fsvi_4bit_two_pass/fourbit_mult5` at 3.6991 ms baseline (`origin/main`) -> 1.5660 ms new (ratio **0.423**, recall@10 still **1.0000** at mult=5) with `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --profile release --bench fsvi_4bit_two_pass fourbit_mult5 -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 2`.

| 2026-06-26 | BlackThrush | `frankensearch-index` WAL tests under parallel `cargo test -p frankensearch-index --lib` | **Flaky cluster** (`compaction_merges_wal_into_main`, `soft_delete_clears_pending_wal_updates_for_same_doc_id`, …): a *different* WAL test fails each parallel run (`assert_eq!(wal_record_count/compaction stats, 2)` panics), but **all 356 pass serially** (`--test-threads=1`) and in isolation (3/3). Not from this campaign (my only `frankensearch-index` changes are bench files; failure is on committed `origin/main`). Diagnosed: temp paths are unique (`name+pid+nanos`), **no global/shared mutable state** in `wal.rs`/`lib.rs`, and `wal_record_count()` is a `const fn` over an in-memory field — so the wrong count under parallel load points to an **IO/mmap read-after-write visibility gap** (WAL file/mmap length not consistently observed after writes when ~356 tests saturate the temp-dir IO), not a logic/state bug. | Conformance gate: `cargo test -p frankensearch-index --lib` is intermittently red in parallel → CI-flaky. **Owner action:** audit `wal.rs` read-after-write / mmap-remap-on-grow under concurrent IO (or mark the WAL tests `#[serial]`). Not fixed here (WAL-internals, another agent's active crate, correctness-critical). |
| 2026-06-26 | BlackThrush (`frankensearch-cod-a`) | `frankensearch-index/dot_product f16_slice` safe direct f16 lane-load probe | Fresh lever attempt: make `widen8_f16_slice` mirror the byte path by directly reinterpreting `[f16; 8]` to `u16x8`, then compare `f16_slice_new` against a bench-only pre-lane-load baseline. The literal requested `cargo bench --release -p frankensearch-index --bench dot_product f16_slice -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 1` failed on remote `ovh-a` with Cargo's known `unexpected argument '--release'`; fallback `cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --bench dot_product --profile release f16_slice -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 2` then failed before measurement because `half::f16: Pod` is not implemented for `bytemuck::cast::<[f16; 8], u16x8>`. | No ratio produced. Probe reverted. Do not retry without either enabling a vetted `half` bytemuck feature across the workspace or introducing unsafe, both of which require a larger proof surface than a one-lever BOLD pass. |
| 2026-06-26 | BlackThrush | **Shared-tree contention blocks clean `simd.rs` commits** + ready-to-land `f32_f32` 4-acc lever | Identified the next dot-kernel lever: `dot_product_f32_f32_unchecked` is still **single-accumulator** and on **real paths** — WAL-entry scoring (`search.rs:528,546`, `two_tier.rs:310,392,415`) and **MRL truncated search** (`mrl.rs:464,497`). It is cheap-decode (plain f32 load), so the 4-accumulator ILP pattern that won for `f32_bytes` (ledger) and `dot_i8_i8` (`0.856`/`0.939`) wins here too — **now MEASURED** (applied the edit, ran `f32_slice_new`=4acc vs `f32_slice_old`=single-acc in-process): **dim384 `820.9µs → 775.0µs = 0.944 (~1.06×)`, dim256 `440.3µs → 433.2µs = 0.984 (~1.02×)**. Smaller than i8/`f32_bytes` (f32 is more load-bound, so less ILP headroom); the dim256 gain is near noise. f32 correctness tests (`simd_matches_scalar_f32`, `large_256d_matches_scalar_f32`) pass with the edit. **Could not LAND it:** `simd.rs` is an active multi-agent battleground — across this + prior iterations agents committed identical 4-acc `dot_i8_i8`, escalated it to 8-acc in uncommitted WIP, and an aggressive edit/revert cycle **reverted my `f32_f32` edit to HEAD three separate times** within minutes, so the edit can't be held long enough to test+commit cleanly. | **Blocker = no file coordination across agents in one shared working dir** (edits don't survive). The win is modest (~1.06× on the conditional WAL/MRL f32 path), so it's **low priority** vs bigger levers. Whoever owns `simd.rs` in an isolated worktree: apply 4 accumulators to `dot_product_f32_f32_unchecked` (bench A/B already exists); the f32 sum reorder is the same accepted non-bit-identical trade as `f32_bytes`. Fleet fix: isolated git worktrees per agent, or `file_reservation` (agent-mail) before editing `simd.rs`/`dot_product.rs`/ledgers. |

## Gated levers (measured headroom that can't be landed as library code)

### 2026-06-27 - BOLD hash-hybrid 4-bit vector backfill is mixed and regresses `limit_all` (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** changed the BOLD `hash_hybrid_tantivy_vector_rrf` candidate path to
use the current FSVI 4-bit two-pass vector primitive (`search_top_k_4bit_two_pass`, mult=5) instead
of the exact flat vector scan. This was the natural follow-up after the 4-bit vector primitive and
fusion fast-tier wins, targeting BOLD rows where the hybrid backfill is still slower than ORIG.

**Measured command (per-crate, RCH remote `hz2`, release profile):**

```bash

Local transcript artifact: `/tmp/frankensearch-bold-4bit-candidate-rerun.log`; the BOLD summary
reported `FRANKENSEARCH_BOLD_VERIFY_OUT=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-b/criterion/bold_verify_4bit_candidate_rerun`.
ORIG comparator is `tantivy_doc_ids`.

| Workload | ORIG p50 | Candidate p50 | Ratio vs ORIG | Decision |
|----------|----------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| `top10/10000 exact_identifier` | 152 us | 124 us | **0.816** | win, but not enough to offset broader misses |
| `top10/10000 quoted_phrase` | 151 us | 146 us | **0.967** | borderline/noisy win |
| `top10/10000 high_fanout` | 82 us | 83 us | **1.012** | tie/noise |
| `top10/10000 zero_hit` | 41 us | 41 us | **1.000** | no gain |
| `limit_all/10000` | 5.466 ms | 5.998 ms | **1.097x slower** | reject |
| `top10/100000 exact_identifier` | 948 us | 974 us | **1.027** | noise/regression |
| `top10/100000 short_keyword` | 59 us | 64 us | **1.085x slower** | reject |
| `top10/100000 natural_language` | 2.033 ms | 1.535 ms | **0.755** | real row win, but not isolated |
| `top10/100000 high_fanout` | 619 us | 620 us | **1.002** | no gain |
| `top10/100000 zero_hit` | 45 us | 41 us | **0.911** | small win |

**Decision:** source reverted. The 4-bit two-pass primitive remains a valid lower-level win, but
dropping it into the BOLD hash-hybrid backfill is not a safe end-to-end lever: it worsens the largest
remaining BOLD materialization gap (`limit_all`) and adds regressions on 100k exact/short rows. Route
next below the candidate materialization/query parser boundary instead of swapping the vector backfill
primitive in this harness.

### 2026-06-25 — AVX2 build is the biggest remaining dot-kernel lever, but it's a build-config knob (BlackThrush)

**Finding:** every SIMD win so far is on an **SSE2-class build** (no AVX2/SSE4.1 — the ~1 ns/elem
f32 dots and the reverted `vpmaddwd` int8 experiment both confirm it). Rebuilding the dot bench
with `RUSTFLAGS="-C target-feature=+avx2,+fma,+f16c"` (separate target dir) measured, back-to-back:

| Workload | SSE2 | AVX2 | AVX2/SSE2 |
|----------|------|------|-----------|
| `dot/dim256/f16_bytes` | 2.09 ms | 0.77 ms | ~0.37 |
| `dot/dim256/f32_bytes` | 1.49 ms | 0.59 ms | ~0.40 |
| `dot/dim384/f16_bytes` | 3.20 ms | 1.94 ms | ~0.61 |
| `dot/dim384/f32_bytes` | 2.30 ms | 1.54 ms | ~0.67 |

**Honest caveat:** these are **cross-run on different rch workers** — the per-dim inconsistency
(dim256 ~2.5× vs dim384 ~1.6×) shows worker variance is mixed in. A clean same-worker pin was
attempted on `vmi1149989` but that worker was contended (SSE2 there ran +27% vs its own baseline
and the AVX2 leg didn't complete). So the real figure is a **~1.5–2.5× range, not a precise ratio**.

**Why it can't be landed as a code lever:**
- A *published* library cannot assume `-Ctarget-cpu`/`target-feature`; consumers compile with their
  own flags, and a workspace `.cargo/config.toml` `+avx2` would make the **released `fsfs` binary**
  crash (illegal instruction) on non-AVX2 hosts.
- Runtime AVX2 dispatch (`is_x86_feature_detected!` + `#[target_feature]`) needs `unsafe`. The crate
  is `deny(unsafe_code)` (opt-in allowed, but a hand-written AVX2 intrinsic dot kernel is a large,
  risky surface — and `wide` only uses compile-time features, so it can't help at runtime).

**Actionable recommendation (not a code change):** deploy targets known to have AVX2 should build
`fsfs` / the consuming app with `RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-cpu=x86-64-v3` (or `native`) for ~1.5–2.5×
faster vector search for free — `wide` then auto-selects its AVX2 paths. This belongs in the
packaging/deploy docs, not the library default. **Do not** add workspace-wide `+avx2` (breaks the
portable released binary).

> **PARTIALLY OVERTURNED 2026-06-28 (BlackThrush):** the "hand-written runtime-dispatched AVX2 kernel
> is too large/risky" judgement was wrong for the **integer** dot. `dot_i8_i8` now runtime-dispatches
> (`is_x86_feature_detected!` + `#[target_feature(enable="avx2")]`, scoped `#[allow(unsafe_code)]`) to a
> ~25-line hand-written AVX2 kernel, **2.26–2.56×** over the `wide` fallback, **bit-identical** (integer
> assoc; proven by `avx2_dot_matches_generic`). See `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md` 2026-06-28 "runtime-dispatched
> AVX2 `dot_i8_i8`". The deploy-flag recommendation still stands as the zero-code option; runtime dispatch
> is the no-config, safe-on-all-hosts option. **Still open:** 4-bit pass-1 (nibble unpack) and the f16
> rescore (F16C — but f32 reorder is NOT bit-identical, so it needs a recall gate not exact equality).

## Residual comparator negatives

### 2026-06-28 — BOLD `limit_all` counted collector does not reproduce as a keep (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** the BOLD frankensearch challenger routed only the `limit_all`
query shape through `search_doc_ids_counted`; the Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class incumbent
(`tantivy_doc_ids`) and all top10 challenger rows stayed on the existing adaptive
`search_doc_ids` path. A dirty bench worktree initially looked like a measured large-limit win,
but the same source port on current `main` did not clear the repo's keep threshold.

| `bold_verify/limit_all/10000` `hash_lexical_guard_tantivy` | 6.129 ms | 5.976 ms | **0.975** | revert: below keep bar |

**Decision:** source reverted; ledger-only. The fresh current-port run failed to reproduce the
bench-worktree win and also exposed non-target slow rows (`top10/10000 high_fanout` hybrid
**1.800x**, guard **2.588x**; `top10/100000 short_keyword` hybrid **1.392x**). Do not broaden
counted collection to top10 high-fanout, and do not land a `limit_all` counted special case unless
a future same-source rerun shows a stable `<0.97` ratio on the large-limit rows without opening
larger top10 regressions.

### 2026-06-27 — `SniffFeatures::from_bytes` branchless `u64` counters are not a win — REVERTED (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** `frankensearch-fsfs::SniffFeatures::from_bytes` counts null,
non-printable, and high-bit bytes with three `u32::saturating_add` guarded increments per byte.
Retried the route-next from the fsqlite-unblocked entry: widen those counters to `u64`, replace the
three guarded increments with `u64::from(predicate)` additions, and saturate only once when writing
`null_bytes`. The goal was to make the per-file sniff histogram easier for LLVM to vectorize.

**Measured command** (per-crate, RCH remote `hz2`, clean worktree
`/data/projects/frankensearch-blackthrush-fsfs-sniff-20260627`, target dir
`/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a`):

```bash
AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-fsfs --profile release \
    --bench sniff_features sniff_features \
    -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 2
```

The bench carried a temporary `old_scalar` arm matching `origin/main` and a `new` arm calling the
candidate `SniffFeatures::from_bytes`, so the ratio is same-binary old-vs-new. The literal
`cargo bench --release` protocol remains invalid for this Cargo (`--profile release` is the working
release-profile equivalent).

| Workload | ORIG p50 | Candidate p50 | Ratio vs ORIG | Decision |
|----------|----------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| `sniff_features/8192` | 9.4628 us | 9.8636 us | **1.042x slower** | revert |
| `sniff_features/65536` | 74.243 us | 75.505 us | **1.017x slower/noise** | revert |

**Decision:** source and `Cargo.toml` changes were reverted. Focused equivalence tests passed while
the candidate was applied (`file_classification` 14/14), and scoped clippy for the touched lib + bench
passed with explicit allows for unrelated existing fsfs lint categories. The measured hot loop does
not benefit from boolean-to-integer `u64` accumulation; keep the current `u32::saturating_add`
branches. Ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class original is **N/A** for this isolated ingest
sniff primitive; it does not move the BOLD search comparator.

### 2026-06-27 — BOLD high-fanout counted collector narrows p50 but still loses vs ORIG — REVERTED (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** for the BOLD `high_fanout` query shape only, keep the
Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class proxy on `tantivy_doc_ids` / `search_doc_ids`, but route the
frankensearch candidate's lexical fetch through `search_doc_ids_counted`. This tested the
query-adaptive collector idea from the count-free top-k evidence: broad, near-universal terms may
lose with WAND-style count-free `TopDocs`, while the counted collector is ranking-identical for
`search_doc_ids` rows (`search_doc_ids_matches_counted_baseline` already covers the equivalence).

**Measured command** (RCH local fallback; per-crate; clean worktree
`/data/projects/frankensearch-blackthrush-bold-dig-fresh-20260627`; target dir
`/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a-bold-fresh`):

Artifact after the candidate run:

The clean `origin/main` baseline summary was run first in the same clean worktree/target dir and was
overwritten by the candidate summary; its key emitted rows were captured before overwrite.

**Clean `origin/main` residual before the candidate (candidate / ORIG):**

| Workload | ORIG p50 | frankensearch p50 | Ratio vs ORIG |
|----------|----------|-------------------|---------------|
| `top10_high_fanout/100000` hybrid | 668 us | 981 us | **1.469x slower** |
| `top10_high_fanout/100000` guard | 668 us | 949 us | **1.421x slower** |
| `limit_all/10000` hybrid | 7.424 ms | 8.987 ms | **1.211x slower** |

**Candidate residual vs ORIG:**

| Workload | ORIG p50 | frankensearch p50 | Ratio vs ORIG | Decision |
|----------|----------|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| `top10_high_fanout/100000` hybrid | 620 us | 759 us | **1.224x slower** | reverted |
| `top10_high_fanout/100000` guard | 620 us | 685 us | **1.105x slower** | reverted |
| `top10_high_fanout/10000` hybrid | 80 us | 69 us | 0.863 | not causal/too noisy |
| `top10_high_fanout/10000` guard | 80 us | 68 us | 0.850 | not causal/too noisy |

The 100k p50 residual narrowed, but the target row still lost to ORIG, and the hybrid p95 ratio was
still bad (`2.087x` slower). The 10k high-fanout rows looked like ORIG wins, but they were not an
absolute speedup against the clean baseline's frankensearch p50s (`65 us -> 69 us` hybrid,
`64 us -> 68 us` guard); the ratio improved because the incumbent moved from `64 us` to `80 us`
between runs. `limit_all/10000` also showed a hybrid p50 win in the candidate run, but the source
hunk did not route `limit_all`, so that row is run variance, not a causal lever.

**Decision:** source hunk reverted. Do not route BOLD `high_fanout` through the counted collector as
a frankensearch-only comparator lever; it can reduce p50 noise but does not land a measured ORIG win
on the biggest residual.

### 2026-06-27 — Move-only `LexicalIdHit -> ScoredResult` conversion does not fix the BOLD materialization gap (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** add `From<LexicalIdHit> for ScoredResult` and make the BOLD
`frankensearch_hash_hybrid` / `hash_lexical_guard` paths consume `Vec<LexicalIdHit>` instead of
cloning every `doc_id` while converting lexical IDs to scored rows. This targeted the biggest
current materialization-looking miss, `bold_verify/limit_all/10000`, where frankensearch returns
rich scored rows while the Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class incumbent stops at IDs.

**Measured command:** the literal requested form still fails in this checkout:
`cargo bench --release -p frankensearch --features lexical --bench search_bench ...` -> Cargo
`unexpected argument '--release'`. Actual per-crate release-profile measurement:

**Observed ratios vs the Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class proxy (candidate / incumbent):**

| Workload | Candidate | Incumbent p50 | Candidate p50 | Ratio | Decision |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------|----------|
| `limit_all/10000` | `hash_hybrid_tantivy_vector_rrf` | 5.593 ms | 5.583 ms | **0.998** | zero-gain |
| `limit_all/10000` | `hash_lexical_guard_tantivy` | 5.593 ms | 5.590 ms | **0.999** | zero-gain |
| `top10/10000 high_fanout` | hybrid | 75 us | 85 us | **1.133x slower** | regression |
| `top10/100000 exact_identifier` | guard | 1.056 ms | 1.189 ms | **1.126x slower** | regression |
| `top10/100000 short_keyword` | hybrid | 507 us | 543 us | **1.071x slower** | regression |
| `top10/100000 zero_hit` | guard | 59 us | 151 us | **2.559x slower** | regression |

The run also had quoted-phrase win rows, but that shape is already known to be volatile/noisy and
the source change only removes `String` clones in the scored-row conversion; it does not alter
Tantivy phrase execution. The target row stayed inside the `[0.97, 1.03]` no-gain band, with
multiple unrelated regressions in the same comparator sweep.

**Conformance:** before the revert, `AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a rch exec -- cargo test -p frankensearch-lexical --lib`
fell back locally after queue timeout and passed (`82 passed; 0 failed`). The source patch was then
reverted; this entry is docs-only.

**Decision:** do not retry move-only `LexicalIdHit` materialization as a BOLD gap lever. The
remaining `limit_all` gap is in Tantivy collection/doc materialization itself, not this extra clone.

### 2026-06-27 — Methodology: `rch exec` can serve a STALE bench binary; verify freshness before trusting latency (BlackThrush)

**Finding (tooling, not a perf result):** benching via `rch exec -- cargo bench` does **not** always rebuild the bench binary on the worker — it can run a cached one. Caught red-handed: after renaming the `sync_int8_fetch` bench's default arm `int8_fetch` → `fast_fetch_4bit` (source confirmed) and re-running through `rch`, the worker still emitted the **old** `int8_fetch` arm name, i.e. it ran a stale binary. So **`rch` latency numbers can reflect old code** and silently mislead an A/B of a fresh change. (A clean local `cargo bench` is the cross-check, but the shared `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` here also hits `E0514` "incompatible rustc" when the local toolchain differs from the worker's — so neither path is automatically trustworthy.)

**Mitigation:** before trusting an `rch` bench A/B, confirm the binary is fresh — e.g. rename/relabel an arm (or print a source-derived sentinel) and verify the new label appears in the output, and check the criterion `estimates.json` mtime is from *this* run. Force a rebuild if in doubt.

**Consequence for the 4-bit query-hoist (`PreparedQuery4bit`, commits f06379c / b300679, a concurrent agent):** I independently implemented the same hoist and my `rch`-based int8_two_pass A/B suggested it was *slower* at small `k` (the prepared-query path adds a per-chunk heap load vs decoding query nibbles in registers) — but given the caching pitfall above, **I do not trust that number** and am NOT claiming a regression. Flagging for a clean, freshness-verified re-measurement (small-`k` scan, same-run vs the inline kernel) before treating the hoist as a confirmed win or loss. Left the on-main hoist untouched (a concurrent agent owns that area).

### 2026-06-27 — 1-bit binary (sign) two-pass for FSVI vector search: recall too low, no speedup (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** follow-up to the landed FSVI int8 two-pass (1.94×, bandwidth-bound).
Hypothesis: a packed sign-bit slab (`dim/8` bytes — ~8× smaller than the int8 slab, ~16× vs f16)
scored by XOR+popcount (Hamming) pass-1 + exact f16 rescore of the top `k·mult` would cut the
dominant bandwidth further. Implemented `VectorIndex::search_top_k_binary_two_pass` mirroring the
int8 two-pass (lazy `vectors_bits` slab, tombstone-aware parallel Hamming scan + cutoff, F16/no-WAL
gate); plumbing verified bit-identical to `search_top_k` under keep-all (`binary_two_pass_keep_all_
matches_exact`).

**Measured (per-crate bench `fsvi_binary_two_pass`, 100k clustered FSVI, dim=384, k=10):**

| mult | recall@10 |  | latency (same fast worker) | vs flat | vs int8 |
|------|-----------|--|----------------------------|---------|---------|
| 2    | **0.150** |  | flat (exact) = 2714 µs     | —       | —       |
| 5    | **0.206** |  | int8 mult=5 = 1014 µs (recall 1.0) | 2.68× | — |
| 10   | **0.300** |  | binary mult=10 = 1093 µs   | 2.48×   | **0.93× (slower)** |
| 20   | **0.438** |  | binary mult=20 = 1840 µs   | 1.48×   | 0.55× (slower) |
| 50   | **0.631** |  |                            |         |         |

**Decision:** rejected and fully reverted (field, method, helpers, test, bench — index crate left
byte-identical to the FSVI-int8 commit). Two independent failures: (1) **recall is far too low** —
1-bit sign quantization collapses 384-d clustered embeddings (clusters share sign patterns), so the
true top-k are not in the candidate set even at mult=50 (0.63); a lossless mult would approach
keep-all. (2) **No speedup even ignoring recall** — integer Hamming distances (0..dim) produce many
ties at the heap cutoff, so the bounded-heap fast-path prunes little; binary mult=10 (1093 µs) ≈ int8
mult=5 (1014 µs, recall=1.0), so the ~8× bandwidth edge is eaten by tie-thrashing + popcount.

**Route next:** sub-int8 quantization is NOT the lever for these embeddings — int8 is the bandwidth
sweet spot (1.94× lossless, landed). A viable binary path would need rotation/PCA before sign (to
de-correlate dimensions) + asymmetric (query-full) scoring — a much larger research effort, not a
clean primitive swap. The FSVI vector-search frontier is int8.

**UPDATE 2026-06-27 (4-bit probe — the sub-int8 lever DOES exist at 4-bit, not 1-bit):** a quick
recall probe (16-level quantization, `q = round(x·7/max_abs)` clamped `[-7,7]`, candidate recall of
the f16 top-10 within the 4-bit top-`k·mult`; N=10k clustered, dim=384) shows **4-bit is recall-
viable, unlike 1-bit binary**:

| level | mult=2 | mult=5 | mult=10 |
|-------|--------|--------|---------|
| 1-bit (binary, rejected above) | 0.150 | 0.206 | 0.300 |
| **4-bit (16-level)** | **0.981** | **1.000** | **1.000** |

So a 4-bit two-pass would be **lossless at mult=5** (10k; needs a 100k confirm) while reading half
the int8 slab (`dim/2` vs `dim` bytes) — a plausible ~1.3–1.5× over the landed int8 two-pass. The
blocker is purely the kernel: unpack-to-buffer writes the full i8 slab (38 MB), negating the 19 MB
read advantage, so the 4-bit dot must be a **register-fused SIMD nibble dot**. `wide 1.4` supports
it (`i16x16` Shl/Shr + `from_i8x16`, `i32x8::from_i16x8`): load 16 packed bytes → `i16x16`,
sign-extend low/high nibbles via `(x<<12)>>12` and `(x<<8)>>12`, multiply (products ≤49), widen-
accumulate. Scoped as a focused follow-up (intricate SIMD kernel + 100k recall/latency validation +
a keep-all bit-identical test); **not landed this turn** to avoid shipping an unverified SIMD kernel.
int8 remains the landed/validated frontier; 4-bit is the next concrete lever.

### 2026-06-27 — BOLD `search_doc_ids` span-removal run is contaminated, not landable (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** remove the two `#[instrument]` spans from the ID-only lexical hot
path (`execute_query_with_offset` and `TantivyIndex::search_doc_ids`) to avoid per-query tracing
span close overhead in the BOLD Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class proxy. The source patch itself was
only those two attribute removals and passed lexical conformance, but the BOLD measurement cannot be
claimed for that lever: while the bench was compiling/running, the shared checkout gained unrelated
uncommitted edits in `frankensearch/benches/search_bench.rs` (exact-ID alias shortcut and
summary-only switch) and `crates/frankensearch-index/src/in_memory.rs` (lazy `doc_id -> position`
map). Those edits were not mine, were not staged, and materially affect the measured harness/path.

**Decision:** reverted the span-removal source patch and landed no code. The run is useful negative
evidence only: BOLD rows are mixed, and the apparent exact-identifier improvement is not
attributable because the BOLD harness changed concurrently. A clean retry must start from an
isolated worktree or first land/reject the unowned exact-ID alias and `doc_id` map edits.

### 2026-06-27 - BOLD exact-identifier alias is a synthetic shortcut, not a landable win (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** add a bench-harness-only alias from query text `doc 000042` to
document id `doc-000042`, then return a synthetic one-row `ScoredResult` with score `1.0` from the
frankensearch challenger before running Tantivy/vector search. This creates a dramatic exact-ID
timing row, but it changes result cardinality and ranking semantics instead of optimizing the real
search path, so it is not conformance-green.

**Decision:** reverted the source patch and landed no code. Do not retry this as a bench-level
shortcut. A future exact-identifier lever must be product-real, preserve the top-k result contract
with tests, and compare against the same Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class BOLD proxy without
synthetic zero-time rows.

### 2026-06-26 — BOLD int8 two-pass vector wiring is not a Tantivy-class win (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** route the BOLD hash-hybrid challenger through a resident
`InMemoryVectorIndex::search_top_k_int8_two_pass(..., candidate_multiplier=5)` instead of the
file-backed exact FSVI vector scan. The candidate kept the Tantivy/Lucene-class incumbent
untouched, added a one-time exactness gate that compared int8 candidate doc-id order with exact
FSVI order for every BOLD query that reached the vector path, and passed that gate before timing.

(`git_sha=28aa02207d1d81a836b645df80172f197e997437`, `worker=unknown`). The summary-only switch
was temporary candidate code to avoid the known Criterion tracing flood; it was reverted with the
int8 wiring. The literal `cargo bench --release` form remains invalid in this checkout, so the
successful per-crate run used Cargo's `--profile release` form.

**Decision:** rejected and reverted. Even with exact vector-candidate order preserved, the
Tantivy-class comparator is mostly worse: the int8 path only helps isolated zero-hit / 100k quoted
rows, while common 10k and 100k rows regress materially.

**Route next:** do not wire int8 two-pass into BOLD hybrid as a blanket replacement. The vector
primitive is still useful for standalone large-N vector scans, but the BOLD gap is dominated by
lexical materialization / tracing / RRF overhead on the mixed query stream, not by exact vector scan
cost alone.

### 2026-06-27 — `id` FAST field for lexical materialization is a large regression (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** the int8 reject above routed next to "the BOLD gap is dominated by
lexical materialization." `TantivyIndex::search_doc_ids` reads each hit's `id` via `load_doc` — a
full stored-document decompress per hit. Hypothesis: mark the `id` field `FAST` and read it
columnar (`segment_reader.fast_fields().str("id")` → `term_ords(doc).next()` + `ord_to_str`),
skipping the docstore decompress entirely. One `StrColumn` cached per segment; docstore fallback for
pre-FAST indexes. Existing 79 lexical tests passed (ids identical), so it is correctness-neutral.

**Measured (per-crate A/B bench `doc_id_materialize`, in-memory Tantivy, 20k high-fanout corpus —
every doc matches — median µs over 80 samples; FAST-field vs docstore `search_doc_ids`):**

| hits (limit) | FAST-field id | docstore id | FAST / docstore |
|--------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| 30   |    408 µs |  154 µs | **2.65× slower** |
| 100  |   1016 µs |  191 µs | **5.32× slower** |
| 300  |   2882 µs |  281 µs | **10.3× slower** |
| 1000 |  11078 µs |  606 µs | **18.3× slower** |

**Decision:** rejected and fully reverted (schema `FAST` flag, the columnar read, the temp bench).
`StrColumn::ord_to_str` resolves each ordinal through the dictionary SSTable (a seek + decode per
hit) — far more expensive than decompressing a small stored doc, and it gets monotonically worse
with hit count. Tantivy's docstore also amortizes via per-block decompression caching across nearby
hit addresses, which a per-ordinal dictionary lookup cannot. A string fast field is the wrong tool
for id materialization.

**Route next:** the materialization cost is real but NOT fixable with a string fast field. Still
plausible: a *numeric* fast field carrying a dense doc ordinal + an external ordinal→doc_id table
(skips the dictionary, but needs segment/delete-aware mapping), or simply fetching fewer lexical
candidates into materialization. Combined with the int8 reject, the BOLD high-fanout gap is bounded
by docstore materialization + RRF + tracing — none cheaply removable by a single primitive swap.

> **UPDATE 2026-06-28 (BlackThrush): the numeric-fast-field route-next is CONFIRMED a large win.**
> A per-crate A/B (`id_materialize_numeric_ff`, kept bench) measured the `u64` dense-ordinal fast field +
> external `ordinal→doc_id` table at **2.56× (k30) → 8.47× (k1000)** faster than the docstore path,
> bit-identical doc_ids. It wins **even at k30** (where the doc_id-cache below was ~0-gain) because the
> numeric column has no dictionary (unlike the str-FAST-field above) and skips the stored-doc decompress.
> See `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md` 2026-06-28 "lexical id materialization: numeric u64 fast-field + ordinal
> table". Production wiring (schema `ord` field + append-only table + `collect_id_hits` fast path with
> docstore fallback; delete/merge-safe via monotonic non-reused ordinals) is the scoped follow-up.

### 2026-06-27 — Lazy doc_id cache for `search_doc_ids` is ~0-gain on the biggest gap (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** the materialization route-next, take 2 — instead of a fast field
(refuted above, slower) cache each hit's `id` lazily per `(segment, local-doc)` in a lock-free
`OnceLock<String>` grid on `TantivyIndex`, keyed by the searcher's segment set (rebuilt on
commit/merge). First access decompresses the stored doc; repeat access — the rotating BOLD query
stream re-hits the same high-BM25 docs — returns a cached `String` clone. Correctness-neutral: all 79
lexical tests pass (incl. the upsert→commit invalidation path).

**Measured (per-crate A/B bench `doc_id_cache`, in-memory Tantivy, 20k high-fanout corpus, cache
warmed; median µs over 100 samples; cached `search_doc_ids` vs the docstore baseline):**

| hits (limit) | cached | docstore | cached / docstore |
|--------------|--------|----------|--------------------|
| 30   | 156 µs | 151 µs | **1.03 (~0-gain)** |
| 100  | 162 µs | 184 µs | 0.88 (1.14×) |
| 300  | 185 µs | 267 µs | 0.69 (1.44×) |
| 1000 | 244 µs | 549 µs | 0.44 (2.25×) |

**Decision:** rejected and fully reverted (cache field, struct, the `search_doc_ids` path, temp
bench — lexical crate left byte-identical to HEAD). The win scales with hit count, but the **biggest**
BOLD gap (top10 `high_fanout`/`natural_language`) fetches only `limit·3 ≈ 30` candidates, where the
cache is ~0-gain (1.03×, within noise). The docstore materialization is **~0.41 µs/hit** (≈12 µs at
30 hits) — a small slice of the ~645–911 µs top10/100k latency — so materialization is **not** the
top10 bottleneck, and an O(N) cell grid + per-doc memory for the common path is not justified by a
large-`limit`-only (e.g. `limit_all`) benefit.

**Route next:** materialization dominates only at very large fetch limits (`limit_all`), not the
top10 hybrid gap. With the int8, str-FAST-field, and now doc_id-cache rejects, the top10
high_fanout/NL gap is bounded by lexical query execution (BM25 over many matches) + RRF + tracing —
none addressable by a single materialization/vector primitive swap; the realistic next probe is the
RRF/tracing overhead on the mixed stream, or accepting the gap as comparator-inherent.

### 2026-06-27 - removing the outer `rrf_fuse` tracing span is noise (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** the BOLD residual route above pointed at RRF/tracing overhead, and
`rrf_fuse` had two nested spans: the public `rrf_fuse` wrapper was instrumented, then immediately
called the already-instrumented `rrf_fuse_with_graph` core. Removing the outer wrapper span should
have reduced one span enter/exit per hash-hybrid fusion while preserving the core span and all
ranking behavior. The production hunk was a single `#[instrument]` deletion on `rrf_fuse`.

Current routing context before the probe (`hash_hybrid_tantivy_vector_rrf` vs `tantivy_doc_ids`,
local BOLD summary `/tmp/frankensearch-bold-current-blackthrush-20260627-2/summary.jsonl`): 10k
quoted phrase was still 1.459x slower, 100k natural-language 1.151x slower, and `limit_all` 1.140x
slower against the Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class proxy.

Literal requested command form remains invalid for this workspace's Cargo:

```bash
AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-b \
  rch exec -- cargo bench --release -p frankensearch-fusion \
    --bench rrf_fuse actual_ -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 1
```

Measured command:

```bash
AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush \
RCH_ENV_ALLOWLIST=AGENT_NAME,CARGO_TARGET_DIR,RUST_LOG \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-b \
RUST_LOG=off \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-fusion --profile release \
    --bench rrf_fuse actual_ -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 1
```

The first before/after attempt was not comparable (`before` local fallback, `after` remote `ovh-a`),
so the bench was tightened temporarily to include an in-binary old-wrapper baseline using the same
`#[instrument]` shape. That same-binary proof ran locally via RCH fallback and measured:

| Workload | Old outer-span wrapper | New wrapper | new / old | verdict |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| `rrf_fuse/actual_old_outer_span_30x30` vs `actual_wrapper_30x30` | 2.2010 us | 2.1935 us | **0.997** | noise / reverted |

`actual_core_30x30` in the same run was 2.1071 us, confirming the core call is a little cheaper,
but the production wrapper-span deletion itself does not clear the 0.97 keep threshold. Ratio vs
Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class original: **none accepted**; this was an isolated challenger RRF
micro-overhead probe and produced no durable BOLD comparator win. Source and temporary bench arms
were reverted; only this ledger entry remains.

### 2026-06-26 — Reusing `QueryClass` inside BOLD hybrid search is mixed/noise (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** compute `QueryClass::classify(query.text)` once in
`frankensearch_hash_hybrid_search`, then pass the enum into
`bold_verify_lexical_prefetch_limit` and `bold_verify_lexical_short_circuit` instead of
reclassifying the same query twice. This was scoped to the BOLD harness path and did not change
Tantivy incumbent behavior or product search semantics.

**Requested protocol blocker:** the literal requested command shape still fails before
measurement on current Cargo:
```bash
AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a \
  rch exec -- cargo bench --release -p frankensearch --features lexical \
  --bench search_bench bold_verify_tantivy_class \
  -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 1
```

RCH selected `hz2`, then Cargo rejected `--release` for `cargo bench` with
`unexpected argument '--release' found`; use `--profile release` for this bench command.

**Measured command (per-crate, warm target dir; RCH shell-wrapper local fallback for output
capture):**
```bash
AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch --features lexical --profile release \
  --bench search_bench bold_verify_tantivy_class \
  -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 1
```

- candidate summary: `frankensearch/.scratch/bold_queryclass_candidate_20260626T0144Z/summary.jsonl`

Both summaries completed all 26 BOLD rows at `git_sha=6b70864826f76ac33a964dd561ef451b39fe88d2`.
The shell wrapper was needed to capture massive tracing output and therefore fell open locally
(`worker=unknown`); the result is valid as a same-machine reject, not as a remote-worker keep.
The post-summary Criterion loop was interrupted after summary emission to stop trace-log growth.

**Decision:** rejected and reverted. Median hybrid p50 movement was noise
(`candidate / baseline = 0.991`), with important short/exact rows regressing beyond the
3% rejection threshold. Some 100k rows improved, but the mixed profile is not a keep and several
candidate rows remain slower than the Tantivy/Lucene-class incumbent.

### 2026-06-26 — Early BOLD short-circuit before `ScoredResult` allocation is not a keep (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** move the BOLD hash-hybrid lexical short-circuit check before
`lexical_doc_ids_as_scored`, so saturated lexical rows can return the raw `LexicalIdHit` vector
instead of allocating temporary `ScoredResult` wrappers first. This was intentionally scoped to
the BOLD harness path after the rejected Tantivy fast-field attempt, leaving the Tantivy incumbent
and `TantivyIndex::search_doc_ids` comparator untouched.

**Measured command (RCH local fallback; no admissible workers:
`insufficient_slots=4,hard_preflight=1`; per-crate, warm target dir):**

Artifact: `/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-b/criterion/bold_verify/summary.md`
and `summary.jsonl`. The BOLD summary completed; the remaining Criterion process was interrupted
afterward because the `#[instrument]` close-event tracing still emitted massive output despite
`RUST_LOG=off`.

**Decision:** rejected and reverted. The isolated 100k natural-language/high-fanout p50 wins are
not acceptable because the same lever leaves the main 10k rows slower and badly regresses the
100k zero-hit row. It is also only a harness allocation reorder, not a library search primitive.

| Workload | Tantivy-class p50 | Candidate frankensearch p50 | Candidate / Tantivy-class | Decision |

| `top10_zero_hit/100000` | 67 us | 174 us | **2.597x slower** | reverted |

**Future route:** the next real lever is not another harness-side wrapper allocation skip. Target
the actual `search_doc_ids` materialization primitive without touching the incumbent comparator,
or suppress/avoid per-hit `#[instrument]` close-event logging in the measurement harness before
trusting very small microsecond deltas.

### 2026-06-26 — Tantivy fast `id` column is a comparator-poisoning loss (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** mark the Tantivy `id` text field as `FAST` and make
`TantivyIndex::search_doc_ids` pull IDs from the per-segment string fast field instead of loading
stored docs. This followed the prior stored-doc materialization hypothesis, but Tantivy text fast
fields are dictionary encoded; resolving each hit still requires `ord_to_str`, and large result
sets repeatedly pay dictionary lookup/decode costs.

`insufficient_slots=5,hard_preflight=1`; per-crate, warm target dir):**

Artifact: `/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-b/criterion/bold_verify/summary.md`
and `summary.jsonl`. The BOLD summary completed; the remaining Criterion process was interrupted
afterward because per-iteration tracing produced massive output.

**Why this is rejected:** the candidate changes the same `search_doc_ids` function used by both
the frankensearch path and the `tantivy_doc_ids` incumbent, so the emitted candidate/incumbent
ratio is comparator-poisoned. Against the prior mainline Tantivy-class ledger, the hot rows are
material regressions:

| Workload | Prior main Tantivy-class p50 | Candidate frankensearch p50 | Candidate / prior Tantivy-class | Decision |
|----------|------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|----------|
| `top10_short_keyword/10000` | 43 us | 310 us | **7.209x slower** | reverted |
| `top10_high_fanout/10000` | 171 us | 245 us | **1.433x slower** | reverted |
| `top10_zero_hit/10000` | 29 us | 140 us | **4.828x slower** | reverted |
| `limit_all/10000` | 9.832 ms | 135.282 ms | **13.76x slower** | reverted |
| `top10_quoted_phrase/100000` | 1.143 ms | 1.130 ms | **0.989x** | isolated/no keep |

Candidate-run examples showing the poisoned incumbent effect:

| Workload | Candidate mutated Tantivy p50 | Candidate frankensearch p50 | Emitted ratio | Why not accepted |
|----------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| `limit_all/10000` | 199.898 ms | 135.282 ms | 0.677 | both sides are >10x slower than prior mainline |
| `top10_short_keyword/10000` | 284 us | 310 us | 1.092 | still slower than the mutated incumbent and far slower than prior mainline |
| `top10_zero_hit/100000` | 87 us | 39 us | 0.448 | isolated win, but same code regresses 10k zero-hit and `limit_all` badly |

**Decision:** reverted all source changes. Text fast fields are not the right ID materialization
primitive for this workload. A future attempt needs an ID retrieval path that does not dictionary
decode per hit, or it must keep the comparator immutable and measure frankensearch-only changes.

### 2026-06-25 — BOLD-VERIFY after lexical prefetch budget gate: mixed, not universal (BlackThrush)

**Lever kept elsewhere:** the BOLD hash-hybrid harness now asks Tantivy for only `k` lexical
candidates, not `3k`, on classes that can legally short-circuit to lexical-only results. The
target natural-language rows became p50 wins vs the Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class incumbent and
are recorded in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`. The same run still has slower/noisy rows below.

**Decision:** keep the scoped prefetch-budget gate because it produced clean p50 wins on the
target natural-language rows (`0.961x` at 10k, `0.962x` at 100k) and several lexical-saturated
rows. Do not generalize it: quoted phrases, 10k short keywords/high fanout/zero-hit, and
`limit_all` still need different levers.

### 2026-06-25 — BOLD-VERIFY after non-semantic zero-hit gate: still scoped, not universal (BlackThrush)

**Lever kept elsewhere:** non-semantic hash/no-quality searches now skip hash-vector work when
lexical returns zero candidates; the 100k zero-hit BOLD row is a real Tantivy-class win and is
recorded in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`. The same run shows the lever does not make the hash-hybrid path
universally faster than the Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class incumbent.

**Decision:** keep the zero-hit gate because it turns the 100k zero-hit BOLD row into a clean
incumbent win and removes the prior catastrophic empty-result vector scan. Do not generalize the
claim: saturated natural-language still spends too much in lexical over-fetch/materialization and
needs a separate lever before it can be called Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class faster.

### 2026-06-25 — BOLD-VERIFY after lexical short-circuit: still not universal dominance (BlackThrush)

**Lever kept elsewhere:** lexical-saturated `Identifier` / `ShortKeyword` queries now skip phase-1
vector scan + RRF once Tantivy has at least `k` hits. The same BOLD run produced two real
Tantivy-class p50 wins, recorded in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`.

**Decision:** keep the scoped short-circuit because it produced real incumbent wins on
`top10_high_fanout/10000` (0.711x) and `top10_exact_identifier/100000` (0.878x), but do not
generalize it. The next radical lever should target semantic gating for natural-language and
zero-hit queries rather than more dot-product work.

## Reverted experiments

### 2026-06-26 — 4-accumulator f16 dot kernel: neutral-to-1.49×-SLOWER (the single accumulator is deliberate) (BlackThrush)

**Cross-kernel-inconsistency probe → rejected, validates the existing design.** `dot_product_f32_bytes_f32`
uses **4 independent `f32x8` accumulators** (to break the FMA dependency chain — its decode is a cheap
load+cast, so the loop is sum-chain-bound and ILP helps), but `dot_product_f16_f32` uses a **single**
accumulator. Hypothesis: the f16 kernel left ILP on the table. Added a faithful `dot_product_f16_f32_4acc`
(same SIMD widen, 4 accumulators) and A/B'd it in-process against the single-acc kernel
(`benches/dot_product.rs`, `f16_slice_new` vs `f16_slice_4acc`):

| corpus | 1 accumulator | 4 accumulators | ratio |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| dim256, n=10k | 1589 µs | 1586 µs | 0.998 (neutral) |
| dim384, n=10k | 2271 µs | 3392 µs | **1.493 (49 % SLOWER)** |

The f16 kernel is **decode/widen-bound, not sum-chain-bound**: the Giesen magic-multiply widen is
register-heavy, so 4 live accumulators + the widen intermediates spill the SIMD register file — hurting
badly at dim384 (the production embedding dim). So the f32_bytes/f16 accumulator-count asymmetry is
**justified, not a missed lever**: cheap-decode kernels want 4 accumulators, expensive-widen kernels want
1. The single accumulator also **preserves the documented bit-identity** of the f16 dot (see `simd.rs`
header) — 4 accumulators would reorder the sum and break it. Probe reverted (zero-gain/regression); the
single-accumulator f16 kernel stays.

### 2026-06-26 — `ScalarQuantizer::dot_product_quantized` is a SIMD-lever TRAP (test-only, not wired) (BlackThrush)

**Not attempted — flagged to save effort.** `ScalarQuantizer::dot_product_quantized` /
`cosine_similarity_quantized` (`crates/frankensearch-index/src/quantization.rs`) are scalar,
single-accumulator per-dim dequant+`mul_add` loops — they *look* exactly like the f16/f32 dot
kernels that won ~3× from a SIMD-widen rewrite, so a profiling/extreme-optimization pass will be
tempted to SIMD them. **Don't:** every non-test caller is `#[cfg(test)]`, and `Quantization::Int8` /
`ScalarQuantizer` is **not** referenced in the production search scans (`search.rs`, `in_memory.rs`).
The production int8 vector search uses the in-memory **i8 corpus-max-abs slab** two-pass
(`search_top_k_int8_two_pass`, see `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`), not this u8/per-dim quantizer. Optimizing
`dot_product_quantized` would be a zero-impact change (dead in production). If a future index format
wires `ScalarQuantizer` into search, re-evaluate then.

### 2026-06-26 — HNSW (ANN) vs flat parallel scan at 10k: a recall/latency trade, not a default win (BlackThrush)

**Lever evaluated (not wired):** the default vector search is a flat O(N) cosine scan
(`VectorIndex::search_top_k` — rayon-parallel + SIMD f16 dot + bounded-heap + cutoff). `HnswIndex`
(behind the `ann` feature, unwired) is an approximate O(log N) graph index — the obvious "radical
lever" for the scan. Validated head-to-head via the new gated bench `benches/hnsw_vs_flat.rs`
(latency + recall@10 sweep over `ef_search`), on **clustered** vectors (64 centroids + noise — the
realistic embedding structure HNSW exploits; uniform-random vectors are a worst case for ANN recall
and gave ~½ these recalls).

**Measured command (per-crate):**
```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cc \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --features ann --bench hnsw_vs_flat
```

| N=10000, dim=128, k=10 | recall@10 | latency | vs flat |
|------------------------|-----------|---------|---------|
| flat `search_top_k` (exact) | 1.000 | 178.4 µs | 1.00× |
| HNSW `knn_search` ef=10 | 0.725 | 69.1 µs | **2.58× faster** |
| HNSW ef=20 | 0.850 | 110.3 µs | **1.62× faster** |
| HNSW ef=40 | 0.925 | 188.5 µs | 0.95× (≈break-even) |
| HNSW ef=100 | 0.950 | 425.3 µs | 0.42× (2.4× slower) |

**Interpretation — HNSW is a recall/latency *trade*, not a free speedup.** HNSW is faster only by
sacrificing recall: it beats the flat scan at `ef ≤ 20` (1.6–2.6×) but at **0.72–0.85 recall**; to
reach high recall (≥0.95) it needs `ef ≥ 100`, where it is **2.4× slower** than flat (break-even is
~ef=40 / recall 0.925). The flat path is hard to beat because it is **rayon-parallel + SIMD f16 dot +
sequential/cache-friendly**, whereas HNSW is a **serial** graph walk with **random** memory access.

**Decision:** do **not** wire HNSW as the **default** vector index — it would be a recall regression
for the exact/high-recall path (and slower if you keep recall high). It *is* a legitimate **opt-in
approximate fast-tier** option (e.g. ef≈20 → 1.6× faster at ~0.85 recall) for latency-sensitive
callers who accept lossy top-k; that's a feature/behaviour choice, not a perf lever for the exact
path. Bench kept (gated behind `ann`) for re-validation at larger N (the crossover improves for HNSW
as N grows). Corrects the earlier uniform-random measurement (which understated recall and called it
a flat loss).

### 2026-06-26 — fusing fingerprint content-hash + char-count is zero-gain (same per-byte work) (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** `Fingerprint::compute` scanned the document twice — `fnv1a_hash(text.as_bytes())` for the
content hash and `text.chars().count()` for the char count. Fused into one byte pass
(`content_hash_and_char_count`): accumulate FNV while counting non-continuation bytes
(`b & 0xC0 != 0x80`, which equals `chars().count()`). Bit-identical — proven by
`content_hash_and_char_count_matches_reference` across ASCII + 2/3/4-byte UTF-8 (896 core lib tests
green, +1 new test).

**Measured command (per-crate):**
```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cc \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-core --bench fingerprint content_hash_charcount
```

| Workload | old (2 passes) | new (fused 1 pass) | ratio | verdict |
|----------|----------------|--------------------|-------|---------|
| `content_hash_charcount` (~2.2 KB doc) | 2868.3 ns | 2873.4 ns | **1.002** | noise / no gain |

**Why it fails:** fusing two byte passes does not reduce the *per-byte* work — the FNV loop is
~2 ops/byte and `chars().count()` is ~1 branch/byte; the fused loop does the same total per-byte
work, just in one loop. The only thing saved is one loop's iteration overhead (negligible), and the
second pass was already cache-warm (the bytes are hot from the first pass). Reverted source + bench
(stashed). Lesson: pass-fusion only helps when a pass is *eliminated* (data reused), not when both
passes touch every byte with comparable per-byte cost.

### 2026-06-26 — moving `LexicalIdHit` into `ScoredResult` is a mixed BOLD result, not a keep (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** the BOLD comparator's private lexical conversion changed from
`lexical_doc_ids_as_scored(&[LexicalIdHit])` cloning each `doc_id` into a `ScoredResult` to
consuming `Vec<LexicalIdHit>` and moving the owned `doc_id`. This targets frankensearch-only
phase-1 overhead that the Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class incumbent does not pay.

**Measured command (per-crate, warm `frankensearch-cod-a`; `rch exec` fell open to local because
no workers were admissible: `insufficient_slots=4,hard_preflight=1`):**
```bash
AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush RCH_ENV_ALLOWLIST=CARGO_TARGET_DIR \

at git `9650b7fe906af38a075048b3b09d1d7349461575`. Caveat: the harness still emitted
high-volume span-close logs despite `RUST_LOG=error`, so this is a reject/routing run, not a
dominance claim.

Key `hash_hybrid_tantivy_vector_rrf` rows vs `tantivy_doc_ids`:

| Workload | Corpus hash | Tantivy-class p50 | frankensearch p50 | Ratio vs Tantivy-class | Decision |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------|

| `top10_zero_hit/100000` | `13f1b0153f5adec9` | 23 us | 20 us | 0.870x | win row, not enough |

**Decision:** reverted the source hunk. Moving owned `doc_id` strings can help individual rows,
but it does not survive the BOLD class mix: the shipped hybrid path regresses exact identifiers,
10k natural-language, `limit_all`, and 100k short-keyword rows. Future work should first fix the
BOLD logging/artifact harness, then target a deeper id-first fusion path rather than repeating this
conversion-only lever.

### 2026-06-25 — branchless f32 sign in `embed_jl` REGRESSES (compiler already selects constants) (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** mirror the SimHash branchless-vote win (`apply_hash_votes`, kept) onto the JL hash
embedder's inner loop. `embed_jl` does `let sign = if (state & 1) == 0 { 1.0 } else { -1.0 }; *dim +=
sign;` per dimension per token (O(tokens·dim)); the xorshift LSB is effectively random, so the branch
*looked* like the same ~50%-mispredict target. Replaced with `let sign = 1.0 - 2.0 * (state & 1) as
f32;`. Bit-identical (43 hash embedder tests green incl. JL determinism/orthogonality).

**Measured command (per-crate):**
```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cc \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-embed --bench hash_embed jl_sign
```

In-process A/B (`jl_sign`, ~100-word doc, dim384; identical except the per-dim sign):

| Workload | branch (`if`/`else`) | branchless (`2*b-1` arith) | ratio | verdict |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------------|-------|---------|
| `jl_sign` | 97.324 µs | 104.990 µs | **1.079** | regression |

**Why it fails (contrast with the kept SimHash win):** SimHash accumulates into **i32** counters, so
`2*b - 1` is cheap integer arithmetic and beats the branch (kept, 0.870×). `embed_jl` selects an
**f32** sign (`+1.0`/`-1.0`); the compiler already lowers the conditional to a branchless **select of
two f32 constants**, whereas the arithmetic form forces an `int→f32` conversion (`cvtsi2ss`) + a float
mul + a float sub per element — strictly more work. **Rule:** branchless arithmetic helps integer
accumulators, not float constant-selection (the compiler handles the latter). Reverted source + bench
(stashed). Do not re-attempt branchless sign on f32 select paths.

### 2026-06-25 — `collapse_code_block` slice-join is zero-gain (join allocs dominate) (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** the long-block branch of `collapse_code_block` collected the head/tail lines into
intermediate `Vec<&str>` (`lines.iter().take(head).copied().collect()` etc.) before `join("\n")`.
Since `[&str]` joins directly, the candidate replaced those with `lines[..head].join("\n")` and
`lines[lines.len()-tail..].join("\n")` to drop the two scratch vectors. Byte-identical (34
canonicalize tests green incl. `collapse_long_code_block`).

**Measured command (per-crate):**
```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cc \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-core --bench canonicalize collapse_code_block
```

In-process old-vs-new A/B (`collapse_code_block`, 60-line block, head=20/tail=10):

| Workload | old (Vec collect + join) | new (slice join) | ratio new/old | verdict |
|----------|--------------------------|------------------|---------------|---------|
| `collapse_code_block` | 254.6 ns | 257.2 ns | **1.010** | noise / no gain |

**Why it fails:** the two `Vec<&str>` collects are ~20 and ~10 pointer copies — negligible next to
the actual work: the two `join("\n")` calls (each allocates + copies the joined output) and the
final `format!`. `<[&str]>::join` iterates the slice the same way the `collect` did, so eliminating
the scratch vectors saves nothing measurable. Reverted source + bench (stashed). Code-block
collapsing is not allocation-bound on the scratch vectors; no lever here.

### 2026-06-25 — caching the Tantivy `QueryParser` is zero-gain (parse dominates) (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** `TantivyIndex::parse_query_lenient` rebuilt a `QueryParser::for_index(..)` +
`set_field_boost(..)` on every BM25 search. Since the schema/tokenizers are fixed for the index's
lifetime and `parse_query_lenient` takes `&self`, the parser was cached as a struct field (built
once in the constructor) and reused. Correct and `Sync` (compiled; 79 lexical lib tests green).

**Measured command (per-crate):**
```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cc \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-lexical --bench query_parser
```

In-process old-vs-new A/B (`query_parser` group; `old` reconstructs the parser per query, `new`
reuses a cached one; both run the identical lenient parse of a 7-token query):

| Workload | old (reconstruct + parse) | new (cached + parse) | ratio new/old | verdict |
|----------|---------------------------|----------------------|---------------|---------|
| `query_parser` | 8384.1 ns | 8336.3 ns | **0.994** | noise / no gain |

**Why it fails:** `QueryParser::for_index` is cheap (~tens of ns: an `Arc` tokenizer-manager clone
+ a small default-fields `Vec` + a boost map). The actual lenient *parse* — tokenizing the query
through both field analyzers and building term queries — costs ~8.3 µs and dominates, so the
construction it eliminates is <1% of the per-query cost, lost in noise. Reverted source + bench
(stashed, not landed). The real lexical materialization gap is `load_doc` (full docstore
decompress per hit in `search`/`search_doc_ids`), which needs a fast/columnar `id` field — an
index-format change, tracked separately; **not** the parser.

### 2026-06-25 — `normalize_whitespace` ASCII byte-scan fast path is SLOWER (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** `normalize_whitespace` (runs on every document at index time) walks `text.chars()` and
pushes char-by-char, then does a trailing `trim_end`/`truncate` pass. The candidate added an
`is_ascii()`-guarded byte path that scanned bytes, bulk-copied each non-whitespace run with one
`push_str`, and emitted the separating space inline (no trailing-trim pass). A custom `is_ws_ascii`
predicate (`b' ' | 0x09..=0x0d`) was used — **not** `u8::is_ascii_whitespace`, which excludes
`\x0b` (vertical tab) and would diverge from `char::is_whitespace`. Byte-identity proven across
vertical-tab/form-feed/mixed cases (`normalize_whitespace_ascii_matches`, 34/34 canonicalize tests
green).

| `normalize_whitespace` (~2.2 KB) | 3.415 µs | 3.910 µs | **1.145** | regression |

**Why it fails:** safe Rust cannot bulk-append a known-ASCII byte slice to a `String` without
`std::str::from_utf8` **re-validating** every run — that per-run validation scan costs more than
the char-by-char path saves, and std's `chars()`/`String::push` already have ASCII fast paths so
the original is near-optimal. The only way to skip validation is `from_utf8_unchecked` (`unsafe`),
and the crate is `deny(unsafe_code)`. **Do not re-attempt** the byte-scan rewrite of
`normalize_whitespace` under the safe-Rust constraint. Reverted source + bench (stash, not landed).

### 2026-06-25 — `search_minimal` lexical trait hook regresses decisive BOLD rows (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** add a `LexicalSearch::search_minimal` hook and route the non-semantic hash-tier
lexical guard through Tantivy `search_doc_ids`, converting those id-only hits back to
`ScoredResult` without loading stored metadata. The goal was to keep the measured BOLD
lexical-guard wins while avoiding full stored-document materialization in product code.

**Measured command (per-crate, warm target dir):**

**Decision:** reverted the trait hook, Tantivy override, BOLD harness variant, and test. The
minimal path wins some broad/materialization-heavy rows, but it gives back or destroys the exact
identifier, high-fanout, and short-keyword rows that make the current lexical guard worth keeping.
Do not add a public minimal-scored trait method until the backend can skip stored-document loading
without hurting these high-selectivity paths. A future attempt should target a private id-first
fusion path that avoids rebuilding owned `ScoredResult` rows for phase 1, then bench against this
same BOLD harness.

### 2026-06-25 — BOLD-VERIFY: hash-hybrid does **not** beat Tantivy-class BM25 (BlackThrush)

**Comparator shipped:** `frankensearch/benches/search_bench.rs` now includes
`bold_verify_tantivy_class`, a same-corpus Tantivy/Lucene-class incumbent harness:
Tantivy `search_doc_ids` vs frankensearch hash embedding + FSVI vector search + Tantivy candidates
+ RRF fusion. This is a **negative dominance check**, not a reverted source lever.

**Measured command:** `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a
rch exec -- env FRANKENSEARCH_BOLD_VERIFY_EMIT=1 RUST_LOG=error cargo bench -p frankensearch
--features lexical --profile release --bench search_bench bold_verify_tantivy_class
-- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 3`

**Evidence:** the full per-crate Criterion pass completed on RCH worker `vmi1152480`. A filtered
summary rerun on RCH worker `hz2` emitted the machine-readable BOLD rows below; the emit flag must
be passed inside `rch exec -- env ...` because the wrapper does not preserve that outer environment
variable. The rows use the same fixed corpus/query harness and report
frankensearch p50 / Tantivy-class p50:

| Workload | Corpus hash | Tantivy-class p50 | frankensearch p50 | ratio |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| `top10_exact_identifier/10000` | `2e78365a46a7c3b9` | 449 us | 1.716 ms | **3.82x slower** |

| `top10_short_keyword/100000` | `13f1b0153f5adec9` | 515 us | 4.082 ms | **7.93x slower** |
| `top10_quoted_phrase/100000` | `13f1b0153f5adec9` | 1.040 ms | 6.412 ms | **6.17x slower** |
| `top10_natural_language/100000` | `13f1b0153f5adec9` | 1.641 ms | 5.756 ms | **3.51x slower** |
| `top10_high_fanout/100000` | `13f1b0153f5adec9` | 647 us | 3.742 ms | **5.78x slower** |
| `top10_zero_hit/100000` | `13f1b0153f5adec9` | 48 us | 2.827 ms | **58.90x slower** |

**Decision:** no Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class win exists for the current hash-hybrid path.
Future bold claims need a new lever that changes the cost model (ANN/int8 slab reuse, lexical
short-circuiting, semantic gating, or a Meilisearch-class prefix/typo comparator), then must reuse
this head-to-head harness. Do not cite frankensearch hybrid as faster than Tantivy-class BM25 from
the current implementation.

### 2026-06-25 — binary-quantization ADC is too coarse for top-10; int8 ADC dominates (BlackThrush)

**Lever assessed (not built):** a Meilisearch-style **binary-quantization** first pass — pack
`sign(x_i)` to bits, rank by Hamming agreement (`popcnt`, fast even on SSE2, 1/16 the bytes of
f16), then exact f16 rescore. Faster pass-1 than int8, so the question is recall. Measured
(`binary_quant_recall_at_10`, random L2-normalized vectors, dim=128, n=3000, recall@10):

| candidate mult | 5 | 10 | 20 | 50 | 100 |
|----------------|------|------|------|------|------|
| binary recall@10 | 0.54 | 0.71 | 0.85 | 0.96 | **1.00** |
| (int8 recall@10) | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 | 1.00 |

**Conclusion:** binary needs `mult ≈ 100` (k·mult = 1000 candidates) for recall ≈ 1.0, vs int8's
`mult = 2` (20 candidates) — ~50× coarser. At frankensearch's typical scale that means rescoring a
large fraction of the corpus, so the **already-shipped int8 ADC two-pass is strictly better** for
top-10. Binary only pulls ahead at very large N (≫1M), where the *fixed* ~1000-candidate rescore
is negligible and the super-fast `popcnt` pass-1 dominates. **Do not build binary ADC** unless
specifically targeting ≫1M-vector corpora. (Probe test kept for reproducibility; no production
code added.)

### 2026-06-26 — 8-accumulator int8 dot is not a robust successor to 4acc (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** extend the shipped `dot_i8_i8` loop from four independent
`i32x8` accumulators over 32 elements to eight accumulators over 64 elements, then try a narrower
384-dim-only gate after the global form regressed the 256-dim path. This is a primitive behind the
int8 ADC pass-1 vector scan, not a direct Lucene/Tantivy-class BM25 comparator; because all code
was reverted, the product-level Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class ratios remain the BOLD rows above.

The literal requested command shape with `cargo bench --release` was checked first and Cargo
rejected it (`unexpected argument '--release'`), so measurements used the equivalent release profile:
`AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --bench dot_product --profile release i8_dot -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 2`.

**Remote `ovh-a`, global 8acc vs bench-local 4acc comparator (Criterion mean):**

| Workload | 4acc comparator | 8acc candidate | candidate/4acc | Decision |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| `dot/dim256/i8_dot` | 376.995 us | 395.577 us | **1.049** | regression |
| `dot/dim384/i8_dot` | 2.410 ms | 1.092 ms | 0.453 | apparent win, not landable because dim256 regressed |

**Local `rch` fallback, 384-dim-gated retry vs bench-local 4acc comparator (Criterion stdout
point estimate):**

| Workload | 4acc comparator | gated candidate | candidate/4acc | Decision |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| `dot/dim256/i8_dot` | 619.51 us | 786.06 us | **1.269** | regression |
| `dot/dim384/i8_dot` | 1.0314 ms | 1.7042 ms | **1.652** | regression |

**Decision:** reverted the production kernel and the temporary bench-only 4acc comparator. The
current 4-accumulator implementation remains the only accepted int8 dot ILP lever; do not retry
8acc without a same-process no-regression proof for 256 and a stable 384 win.

### 2026-06-25 — SIMD-widen int8 dot (`i16x16::dot`/`vpmaddwd`) is SLOWER on this build (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** rewrite `dot_i8_i8` from scalar `i16::from` widening (16 `movsx` per 8 elems) to a
fully-SIMD 16-wide kernel: `[i8;16]` → `i8x16` → `i16x16` (sign-extend) → `i16x16::dot`
(`vpmaddwd`, pairwise products → `i32x8`). Correct (`dot_i8_i8_matches_scalar` green incl. the
all-(−128)/512-dim overflow case), but measured a **regression** vs the committed scalar-widen
kernel:

| Workload | int8/f16 ratio (scalar-widen, kept) | int8/f16 ratio (SIMD-widen) |
|----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| `dot/dim256/i8_dot` | 0.331 | **0.508** |
| `dot/dim384/i8_dot` | 0.311 | **0.442** |

(in-process int8-vs-f16 ratio; higher = int8 got relatively slower). Normalizing for worker
speed, the SIMD-widen int8 dot is ~1.5× **slower** than scalar-widen.

**Why it fails:** this is an **SSE2-class build** (no AVX2/SSE4.1 — consistent with the ~1 ns/elem
f32 dots seen elsewhere). `i8→i16` `vpmovsxbw` and 256-bit `i16x16` are then *emulated* (unpack +
arithmetic-shift over two SSE registers), which costs more than 16 plain scalar `movsx`. "Portable
SIMD" loses to scalar when the target lacks the widening instruction. Reverted to scalar-widen.
**Do not re-attempt** without either a runtime AVX2/SSE4.1 dispatch or `-Ctarget-cpu` that enables
those features (which the published library cannot assume).

### 2026-06-24 — int8 ADC two-pass does NOT beat *parallel* exact at top-10/10k (BlackThrush)

**Self-correction of an earlier overstated result.** The `3ecfad8` bench reported the int8 ADC
two-pass ~2.6–3× faster than "exact f16", but that baseline (`topk_exact_f16`) was a **serial
full-sort** pipeline. The **real product** `InMemoryVectorIndex::search_top_k` is **rayon-parallel
+ bounded-heap + cutoff** — much faster. Benching the real shipped methods head-to-head
(`inmem_topk`, 10k vectors, top-10, mult=20, parallel pass-1):

| Workload | exact `search_top_k` (parallel) | `search_top_k_int8_two_pass` | ratio |
|----------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| `inmem_topk/dim256` | 306 µs | 373 µs | **1.22 (regression)** |
| `inmem_topk/dim384` | ~400–700 µs (very noisy) | 393 µs | inconclusive |

**Root cause:** the int8 *kernel* is genuinely ~3× faster (that stands — `33fb45b`), but the
two-pass **method** materializes all N int8 scores into a `Vec` then selects serially, while the
exact path never materializes more than the top-k heap and runs across all cores. At 10k the
already-parallel+cutoff exact is ~300 µs; the two-pass's full-N materialize + serial select eats
the kernel win. So the int8 ADC two-pass is **not** a win at this scale/path.

**Honest scope of the kept results:** int8 dot ~3× (kernel, real), recall@10 = 1.0 (real). The
**search-level** speedup only holds vs a *serial* exact — it does **not** beat the product's
parallel exact at 10k. The lever's real upside is at larger N (100k+, where parallel exact also
slows and bandwidth matters more) or the mmap FSVI path (page-fault + decode overhead), or with a
**bounded-heap parallel pass-1** (avoid the full-N materialize). Filed as a follow-up.

**Decision:** the `search_top_k_int8_two_pass` method is kept (correct, opt-in, bit-identical when
recall=1 — proven by `int8_two_pass_matches_exact_topk`; a foundation), but it carries **no
verified perf-win claim at 10k**. PERF_LEDGER corrected accordingly.

### 2026-06-24 — multi-accumulator unrolling of the **f16** dot-product kernels (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** rewrite `dot_product_f16_f32` and `dot_product_f16_bytes_f32` to use 4 independent
`f32x8` accumulators (32 elements/iter) instead of 1, to break the SIMD-add latency chain.

**Measured head-to-head** (`benches/dot_product.rs`, `*_new` = 4-acc, `*_old` = original
single-acc, same process / same CPU, n=10 000 dots):

| Workload | old (median) | new (median) | ratio new/old | verdict |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `dot/dim256/f16_bytes` | 12.483 ms | 13.504 ms | **1.082** | regression |
| `dot/dim384/f16_bytes` | 17.486 ms | 18.115 ms | **1.036** | regression |
| `dot/dim256/f16_slice` | 10.242 ms | 14.909 ms | **1.456** | regression (noise-inflated) |
| `dot/dim384/f16_slice` | 13.489 ms | 14.277 ms | **1.058** | regression |

**Why it fails:** the f16 paths are **decode-bound** — the per-element scalar `f16::to_f32()`
conversion dominates, so the accumulation latency the change targets is a negligible fraction.
The restructure (chunks_exact(32) + `try_into` per sub-block + two-phase remainder) only adds
setup overhead. Reverted these two kernels to the original single-accumulator form.

**Connects to historical revert `816963a`:** the human previously reverted `88c291b`
("…multi-accumulator unrolling"), which *bundled* this f16 kernel change with a
`select_nth_unstable` heap-merge (unstable sort → breaks deterministic tie ordering) and a
16-elem unroll. This measurement isolates the kernel part and confirms it is **not** a win on
the f16 (default-quantization) path independent of the heap change. Do not re-attempt
accumulator unrolling on f16 kernels without first making the f16→f32 decode SIMD (a
branchless `i32x8`/F16C widen), which is the actual bottleneck.

**Kept from the same experiment:** the `f32_bytes` kernel restructure was a genuine ~3× win
(decode-bound on open-ended slices, not accumulation) → see `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`.

### 2026-06-24 — f32 slice multi-accumulator portability check (BlueGull)

**Lever:** apply the same 4-accumulator, 32-element loop shape to `dot_product_f32_f32`.

**Evidence:** after the f16 revert, this command fell back local because RCH had no admissible
workers:

```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --profile release --bench dot_product
```

That local fallback measured `dot/dim256/f32_slice` at 1.4206 ms old vs 2.3436 ms new,
ratio **1.650** (regression). A later pinned-worker run with the source hunk reverted
measured the slice rows as noise-only routing checks, not a kept source change.

**Superseded 2026-06-26 by BlackThrush:** this local fallback was contradicted by an admitted
remote RCH same-process run on `vmi1227854`, which measured the f32 slice 4-accumulator kernel at
0.318 (dim256) and 0.610 (dim384) vs the embedded single-accumulator baseline. The current
decision is **ship the f32 slice rewrite** with the scope caveat above: it is a frankensearch
microkernel win, not a Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class end-to-end dominance claim.

### 2026-06-26 — BOLD re-check: f32/f32 4-accumulator slice dot is still not a win (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** a dirty worktree hunk rewrote
`dot_product_f32_f32_unchecked` from one `f32x8` accumulator over 8 elements to four accumulators
over 32 elements. This was the later `ready-to-land f32_f32 4-acc lever` note from the measurement
blockers table, but it had not been proven head-to-head on this tree. The hunk is a vector
primitive, not a direct Lucene/Tantivy-class BM25 comparator; because it was reverted, product-level
Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class ratios are unchanged.

The requested `cargo bench --release` form failed again with Cargo's
`unexpected argument '--release'`, so the measured command was:

```bash
AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --bench dot_product --profile release \
  f32_slice -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 2
```

RCH fell back local (`no admissible workers`) but the bench is in-process `new` vs `old`, so the
ratio is still same-run:

| Workload | old single-acc | 4acc candidate | candidate/old | Decision |
|----------|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| `dot/dim256/f32_slice` | 2.4522 ms | 2.5077 ms | **1.023** | neutral / revert |
| `dot/dim384/f32_slice` | 2.9224 ms | 3.0636 ms | **1.048** | regression |

**Decision:** reverted the `simd.rs` hunk. Do not land the f32/f32 4-accumulator slice rewrite from
the shared worktree; the earlier ready-to-land note is superseded by this BOLD re-check.

### 2026-06-24 — detached-worktree f16 accumulator candidate (frankensearch-cod-b)

**Context:** a detached worktree at
`/data/projects/frankensearch-cod-b-baseline-20260624T221243Z` was used to compare
`HEAD` plus the `dot_product` bench harness against a 4-accumulator SIMD candidate that was
not on `main`. The accepted release-profile command could not be admitted by RCH (see
Measurement blockers), so the only completed same-worker numbers are Cargo's optimized bench
profile on worker `vmi1152480`.

**Bench-profile RCH before/after (`cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --bench dot_product
-- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 3`):**

| Workload | before median | after median | ratio new/old | verdict |
|----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| `dot/dim256/f16_bytes/10000` | 7.1007 ms | 3.9052 ms | 0.550 | routing win, not kept |
| `dot/dim256/f16_slice/10000` | 5.0532 ms | 4.0380 ms | 0.799 | routing win, not kept |
| `dot/dim384/f16_bytes/10000` | 7.0845 ms | 5.7334 ms | 0.809 | routing win, not kept |
| `dot/dim384/f16_slice/10000` | 5.6829 ms | 6.0270 ms | 1.061 | regression |

**Decision:** do not land this detached-worktree f16 accumulator candidate. It regresses a
tracked `f16_slice` workload and conflicts with the stronger in-process old-vs-new evidence
above, which isolates the f16 accumulator rewrite without cross-run Criterion noise. The
follow-up is `bd-gfzk`: attack the actual default-path bottleneck, scalar f16-to-f32 decode,
with an exhaustive correctness proof before rebenchmarking.

### 2026-06-24 — `f16_slice` u16x8 SIMD load (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** mirror the landed `f16_bytes` SIMD-load refinement (`c0e9c80`) onto the slice path
`widen8_f16_slice` — build a `u16x8` of `to_bits()` lanes and zero-extend to `u32x8` (16-byte
stack slot + `vpmovzxwd`) instead of materializing a `[u32; 8]`. Bit-exact (20/20 simd tests
green); the slice path feeds `dot_product_f16_f32` (`in_memory.rs:480`, two-tier quality rescore).

**Measured** (`f16_slice_new` crate vs `f16_slice_old` scalar, in-process; ratios are the only
worker-robust signal across runs):

| Workload | prior ratio (`[u32;8]`) | this change (`u16x8`) | verdict |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| `dot/dim256/f16_slice` | 0.364 | **0.508** | no gain / hint of regression |
| `dot/dim384/f16_slice` | 0.394 | **0.420** | no gain (≈ noise) |

**Why reverted:** this run landed on a much slower/contended worker (absolute times ~2× the
prior run) and the cross-run ratio moved the **wrong way** on dim256 (0.364→0.508). With no
clean in-process A/B to isolate the load change from the fully-scalar baseline, there is no
demonstrated gain (and a hint of regression). Per "REVERT ~0-gain", reverted to the committed
`[u32; 8]` form. The byte-path SIMD load (`c0e9c80`) stays — it showed a consistent directional
improvement on both dims; the slice path did not. A clean keep/reject would need an in-process
"SIMD-widen + scalar-load" baseline added to `dot_product.rs` (left for a future pass).

### 2026-06-25 — non-semantic lexical guard is NOT a universal Tantivy-class win (BlackThrush)

**Kept change, bounded claim.** The hash-tier lexical guard is a real improvement over the old
hash-hybrid path (see `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`), but the same BOLD-VERIFY run still shows several
rows slower than the `tantivy_doc_ids` lexical proxy used for Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class
comparison.

Command:

```bash
RCH_ENV_ALLOWLIST=CARGO_TARGET_DIR \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-b \

| Workload | guarded p50 ratio | guarded p95 ratio | verdict |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| `top10/10000/exact_identifier` | 1.074 | 1.359 | near, but not a win |
| `top10/10000/quoted_phrase` | 1.031 | 1.330 | near, but not a win |
| `top10/10000/natural_language` | 1.040 | 1.067 | near, but not a win |
| `top10/10000/zero_hit` | 1.000 | 3.333 | p50 parity, tail miss |
| `top10/100000/exact_identifier` | 1.161 | 1.820 | miss |
| `top10/100000/short_keyword` | 1.208 | 1.439 | miss |

| `top10/100000/high_fanout` | 1.010 | 1.236 | near, but not a win |

**Interpretation:** skipping hash embedding/vector/RRF is necessary but not sufficient for full
lexical-engine parity. The remaining overhead is in frankensearch's result materialization and
the fact that the incumbent comparator returns doc ids, while the guarded path produces
`ScoredResult`-class results. Do not claim Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch dominance from this change.

**Next lever:** avoid eager `ScoredResult` string/materialization for lexical-only Phase 1
(borrowed/id-first result lane or lazy metadata resolution), then rerun the same BOLD matrix.

### 2026-06-26 — id-first RRF lexical hits are not a BOLD win (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** added a feature-gated `rrf_fuse_lexical_ids` path so the
hash-hybrid BOLD lane could pass `LexicalIdHit` rows directly into RRF instead of first
materializing `ScoredResult` rows. This targeted the materialization gap called out in the
2026-06-25 lexical-guard evidence. Behavior was guarded with
`cargo test -p frankensearch-fusion --features lexical lexical_id_fusion_matches_scored_rrf --lib`
through `rch exec` (remote `ovh-a`, pass), but the end-to-end BOLD matrix was mixed and mostly
worse.

The requested `cargo bench --release` form remains invalid for this harness (`unexpected argument
'--release'`), so the measured command used the accepted release profile form:

```bash
AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush RCH_ENABLED=0 \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a \

| `top10/100000/zero_hit` | 1.305 | 124 | 95 | regression |

Compared with the baseline artifact, the hybrid p50 ratio worsened on 9 of 13 rows, including
`top10/10000/high_fanout` (1.156 → 1.631) and `top10/100000/zero_hit` (1.034 → 1.305).
Because the candidate does not produce a durable Lucene/Tantivy-class win, the code was reverted
and only this ledger entry is kept. A future attempt should attack the remaining Tantivy wrapper
overhead without disturbing high-fanout and zero-hit tails.

### 2026-06-27 — shared exact-id lexical probe is not a hybrid BOLD win (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** added a real production exact-id probe to
`frankensearch-lexical` so identifier-shaped queries such as `doc-000001` and `doc 000001`
searched the Tantivy `id` field before falling back to normal content/title BM25. The probe was
behaviorally valid (`search_doc_ids_exact_identifier_alias_hits_id_field` and
`search_doc_ids_exact_identifier_alias_miss_falls_back_to_bm25` passed), but it is a shared
lexical-backend improvement: the `tantivy_doc_ids` Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class proxy benefits
too, while the hash-hybrid challenger still falls through to vector/RRF when the exact lexical hit
count is below `limit=10`.

Hybrid candidate vs Tantivy-class proxy:

| Workload | candidate p50 ratio | candidate p50 us | Tantivy p50 us | verdict |
|----------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| `top10/10000/exact_identifier` | 28.300 | 1132 | 40 | severe regression |
| `top10/100000/exact_identifier` | 133.125 | 4260 | 32 | severe regression |
| `top10/10000/quoted_phrase` | 1.147 | 164 | 143 | miss |
| `top10/100000/natural_language` | 1.220 | 1935 | 1586 | miss |
| `top10/100000/high_fanout` | 1.006 | 661 | 657 | miss |

The lexical-guard lane confirmed why this is not enough: `top10/10000/exact_identifier` improved
to 0.825x (33 us vs 40 us), but `top10/100000/exact_identifier` still lost at 2.875x (92 us vs
32 us), and the shipped hybrid path regressed dramatically. The exact-id probe was therefore
reverted. A future lever must either make the hybrid exact-hit path terminate on high-confidence
identifier hits without changing recall contracts, or move to a separate exact-id lookup structure
that is not also granted to the Tantivy-class incumbent.

### 2026-06-27 — sparse lexical underfill short-circuit is not a BOLD win (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** changed the BOLD hash-hybrid harness so any under-filled
`search_doc_ids` result (`lexical_count < limit`) short-circuited before hash embedding, vector
scan, and RRF. This came from the query-processing decision-barrier pattern in the alien-graveyard
dig: when the fast tier is a non-semantic hash and Tantivy has already proven the lexical result
set is sparse, extra vector/RRF work has no semantic recall value. It is also aligned with the
production `TwoTierSearcher` hash-only lexical path, but the BOLD matrix did not produce a durable
Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class win.

Command:

```bash

Required `frankensearch-cod-b` reruns were attempted after the revert, but did not emit BOLD rows
before the local harness returned code 130, so no code change is shipped from this evidence.

Hybrid candidate vs Tantivy-class proxy:

| Workload | candidate p50 ratio | candidate p95 ratio | candidate p50 us | Tantivy p50 us | verdict |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------|----------------|---------|
| `top10/100000/quoted_phrase` | 1.107 | 0.906 | 1295 | 1170 | p50 miss; p95 win only |
| `top10/100000/exact_identifier` | 0.945 | 1.007 | 1698 | 1797 | p50 win only |

| `limit_all/10000` | 1.196 | 1.251 | 11566 | 9671 | regression |

The old 100k quoted-phrase miss from 2026-06-25 was 2.068x, so this lever did narrow the biggest
stale measured gap, but it still failed p50 parity against the Tantivy-class proxy and introduced
too many mixed rows. Per the revert rule, the code was restored and only this ledger entry is kept.

### 2026-06-27 — count-free top-k (drop the `Count` collector) is a mixed result, not a clean win (CopperLark)

**Lever tested and reverted:** `execute_query_with_offset` runs `(TopDocs::with_limit(k).order_by_score(), Count)`.
The `Count` collector must visit *every* matching document, which forces Tantivy to disable the
block-max WAND top-k pruning that `TopDocs` can otherwise use to skip low-scoring blocks.
`search_doc_ids` (the `tantivy_doc_ids` Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class BOLD proxy **and** the
hybrid lexical-candidate source) only reads `.hits` and **discards `total_count`** — so the Count
work is wasted there. The lever added a count-free `execute_top_k` (identical ranked hits, no
`Count`), routed `search_doc_ids` through it, and kept a `#[doc(hidden)] search_doc_ids_counted`
baseline so a new per-crate bench (`crates/frankensearch-lexical/benches/doc_ids_topk.rs`) could
A/B `free` vs `counted` in one binary on a 100k in-RAM index.

**Conformance:** GREEN — `cargo test -p frankensearch-lexical --lib` = **79 passed; 0 failed**. The
collector choice does not change which docs `TopDocs` returns, so both paths yield identical ids.

**Command** (RCH fell back to local — `[RCH] local (no admissible workers: insufficient_slots=3)`):

```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cc \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-lexical --bench doc_ids_topk \
    -- --sample-size 20 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 2
```

**Measured `free`/`counted` ratio (median; `< 1.0` = count-free faster):**

| Corpus / workload | counted | free | ratio | verdict |
|-------------------|---------|------|-------|---------|
| BOLD-mirror `high_fanout` (`search`) | 630.6 us | 637.1 us | **1.010** | neutral |
| BOLD-mirror `short_keyword` (`rust ownership`) | 233.9 us | 63.3 us | **0.271** | big win |
| BOLD-mirror `quoted_phrase` (`"reciprocal rank fusion"`) | 1.825 ms | 1.083 ms | **0.593** | win |
| BOLD-mirror `natural_language` (7-term) | 728.6 us | 1.508 ms | **2.070** | regression (noisy 0.99–2.23 ms) |
| synthetic uniform-vocab `high_fanout` (1 term) | 286.0 us | 222.3 us | 0.777 | win |
| synthetic `union3` / `natural` / `phrase` (multi-term) | — | — | 1.66 / 3.56 / 1.12 | regressions |

**Interpretation:** count-free WAND wins large on *selective* queries (`short_keyword` 0.271,
`quoted_phrase` 0.593 — two of the actual BOLD gap rows) but **regresses ~2x on
`natural_language`**, a broad disjunction dominated by the corpus-wide `search` term (present in
every BOLD doc): WAND pays its block-max bookkeeping but can't prune a near-universal posting list,
so it loses to the plain `Count` linear scan. This is the known block-max-WAND pathology for
low-IDF disjunctions. Because a real BOLD workload regresses ~2x, the change **cannot land
unconditionally** (repo rule: regression > 1.03 → revert), so all code was reverted and only this
entry is kept.

**Ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch = N/A:** the in-repo `tantivy_doc_ids` proxy *is*
`search_doc_ids`, so this collector change would move the proxy and the hybrid identically — the
BOLD *ratio* vs the proxy is unchanged by construction. The A/B above isolates the collector-choice
effect (what real count-free-WAND engines experience), not a head-to-head incumbent ratio.

**Real lever for a future agent:** a *query-adaptive* collector — count-free (`TopDocs` alone, WAND)
for selective queries (short-keyword / phrase / identifier), counted (full scan) for broad
natural-language disjunctions that include a corpus-saturating term. Validate on a realistic
Zipfian corpus *without* a universal term (where `natural_language` may also win) before landing;
do not re-attempt the unconditional drop.

### 2026-06-27 — count-free simple `search_doc_ids` is a narrow Tantivy-wrapper win, not BOLD dominance (BlackThrush)

**Lever kept with scope limits:** `frankensearch-lexical::TantivyIndex::search_doc_ids` now skips
Tantivy's discarded `Count` collector only for single plain-token queries. Boolean, phrase, fielded,
wildcard, boosted, path-like, and hyphenated queries keep the counted execution path so Tantivy query
semantics and pagination-sensitive collectors stay out of this optimization.

Per-crate Tantivy-wrapper ratios:

| Workload | Query shape | counted median | new median | ratio | verdict |
|----------|-------------|----------------|------------|-------|---------|
| `high_fanout` | single plain token | 499.086 us | 239.233 us | **0.479** | kept narrow win |
| `union3` | multi-token boolean fallback | 804.545 us | 926.472 us | 1.152 | not claimed |
| `natural` | multi-token boolean fallback | 1141.046 us | 1312.298 us | 1.150 | not claimed |
| `phrase` | phrase fallback | 1140.312 us | 1414.064 us | 1.240 | not claimed |

The ratio above is against the prior counted Tantivy top-k wrapper in frankensearch, used here as
the local Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch-class lexical collector proxy. The non-simple rows are retained
as negative evidence rather than a claimed win; they stay on the counted path in source and are
dominated by the extra guard plus noisy tracing-heavy Criterion order. This is not a new BOLD
end-to-end dominance claim over Lucene, Tantivy, or Meilisearch: the accepted original-comparator
ratio is **N/A** for this isolated wrapper primitive, while full hybrid BOLD gaps remain governed by
the existing comparator ledger rows.

### 2026-06-27 — do NOT extend count-free top-k to phrase queries (CopperLark, corroborates BlackThrush)

Independently re-derived the count-free `search_doc_ids` lever before noticing BlackThrush had
landed the single-plain-token gate (`use_count_free_top_k`, PERF_LEDGER 2026-06-27). The obvious
next step — broadening the gate to **phrase** queries (phrases use a `PhraseScorer`, so I expected
dropping `Count` to be strictly safe) — was tested with a dedicated `doc_ids_phrase` A/B on the
100k BOLD-mirror corpus and is **not** safe. Per-shape `free`/`counted` medians:

| Phrase query | counted | free | ratio | verdict |
|--------------|---------|------|-------|---------|
| `"reciprocal rank fusion"` (theme, ~1/6) | 1.151 ms | 1.148 ms | 0.998 | noise |
| `"approximate nearest neighbor"` (theme, ~1/6) | 1.113 ms | 1.226 ms | 1.101 | regression |
| `"kubernetes health check"` (theme, ~1/6) | 1.285 ms | 1.085 ms | 0.844 | win |
| `"common search corpus term"` (universal, all docs) | 8.333 ms | 10.31 ms | 1.237 | regression |

The result is **workload-dependent even within phrases** (one shape wins 0.844, another regresses
1.24), and the prior cycle's single `quoted_phrase` 0.593 (entry above) did **not** reproduce
(0.998 here) — it was local-fallback contention noise. So the tempting `0.844` win is a trap: there
is no safe, corpus-independent way to gate count-free for phrases. BlackThrush's single-plain-token
boundary is the correct stopping point; do not broaden it to phrase/Boolean shapes without
per-query corpus statistics. Conformance was green (`cargo test -p frankensearch-lexical --lib`,
80 passed) and all probe code was reverted — only this entry is kept.

### 2026-06-27 — 4 independent accumulators REGRESS the 4-bit prepared dot kernel (decode-bound, not sum-chain-bound) (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** apply the proven multi-accumulator ILP pattern to `dot_4bit_prepared`
(`crates/frankensearch-index/src/simd.rs`) — the pass-1 hot kernel of the current vector frontier,
`search_top_k_4bit_two_pass` (landed 1.40× vs int8 / 3.09× vs flat). That kernel uses a **single**
`i16x16` accumulator with a periodic flush, i.e. exactly the single-accumulator add chain that
`dot_i8_i8`'s own comment says cost 6–16% and was fixed there with 4 independent `i32x8`
accumulators. Natural hypothesis: the same 4-accumulator split should win on the 4-bit kernel too.
I rewrote it to 4 independent `i16x16` accumulators processing 4 chunks per iteration (flush every
256 chunks for overflow safety; integer-exact, so bit-identical — `dot_packed_4bit_matches_scalar`
still passes).

**Measured (in-process A/B, `dot_product` bench; `fourbit_4acc` = new, `fourbit_1acc` = original
single-acc, both over the *same* prepared query so the ratio isolates only the accumulator change).
New arm names doubled as a freshness sentinel — both appeared, so the bench binary was not stale.**

Remote `rch` worker `ovh-a` (`cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --profile release --bench
dot_product -- fourbit --sample-size 10 --measurement-time 3`) caught a contended window on the
`fourbit_4acc` arm (CI `[405 µs … 714 µs]`), but its identical sibling `fourbit_prepared_new`
(same lib fn) measured cleanly at **325.9 µs** vs `fourbit_1acc` **318.3 µs** → **1.024 (slower)**.

Clean local re-measure (`--sample-size 30`), `fourbit_4acc` / `fourbit_1acc` medians:

| dim | 1 acc (old) | 4 acc (new) | ratio | verdict |
|-----|-------------|-------------|-------|---------|
| 256 | 304.08 µs | 332.09 µs | **1.092** | regression |
| 384 | 385.69 µs | 409.96 µs | **1.063** | regression |

**Decision:** rejected and fully reverted (`simd.rs` + the bench A/B arms restored byte-identical to
`main`; `git diff` empty before this entry). Both runs and both dims agree directionally: the
4-accumulator split is **6–9 % slower**. Root cause: `dot_4bit_prepared` is **decode-bound**, not
sum-chain-bound — each 16-byte chunk pays one `i16x16` widen plus **four shifts** to sign-extend the
low/high nibbles (`(s<<12)>>12`, `(s<<8)>>12`) before the two multiplies, so the single `acc +=` add
is *not* the binding loop-carried dependency. Extra accumulators only add register pressure /
scheduling overhead. This is the same regime the `dot_i8_i8` comment already flags for the
decode-bound f16 dot ("extra accumulators regress"); the int8 win does **not** transfer because the
i8 decode is a cheap one-op sign-extend while the 4-bit decode is shift-heavy.

**Route next:** the 4-bit pass-1 frontier is gated by **nibble-decode op count**, not accumulator
ILP. A real win there must *reduce decode work* (fewer shifts per chunk / a cheaper sign-extend), not
add accumulators. Do not re-attempt multi-accumulator on `dot_4bit_prepared`. Original-comparator
ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is **N/A** for this isolated vector kernel.

### 2026-06-27 — and cutting a shift (`s>>4` high nibble) ALSO regresses — the decode bottleneck is not shift count (BlackThrush)

**Follow-up to the entry directly above** (closing its own "route next: reduce decode work"). The
high nibble was decoded as `(s<<8)>>12` (2 shifts). Because `from_i8x16` already copies the byte's
bit 7 — which *is* the high nibble's sign bit — across bits 8..15, the high nibble can be
sign-extended in **one** arithmetic shift, `s >> 4`, taking the per-chunk decode from 4 shifts to 3.
Integer-exact (`dot_packed_4bit_matches_scalar` passed). Hypothesis: a shift-bound decode should
speed up ~proportionally.

**Measured (in-process A/B, single accumulator both sides; `fourbit_3shift` = lib `s>>4`,
`fourbit_4shift` = local `(s<<8)>>12`; same prepared query so the ratio isolates only the
shift-count change; new names served as a freshness sentinel and both appeared).** `3shift/4shift`
medians:

| dim | 4 shifts (old) | 3 shifts (new) | ratio | environment |
|-----|----------------|----------------|-------|-------------|
| 256 | 283.81 µs | 296.18 µs | **1.044** | local |
| 256 | 379.85 µs | 396.32 µs | **1.043** | rch `ovh-a` |
| 384 | 357.42 µs | 355.71 µs | 0.995 | local |
| 384 | 499.98 µs | 520.90 µs | **1.042** | rch `ovh-a` |

**Decision:** rejected and fully reverted (`simd.rs` + bench arms byte-identical to `main` before
this entry). Two independent environments agree: dropping a shift is **~4 % slower** (dim256 both
runs, dim384 on the cleaner rch worker; the one local dim384 tie is the noise floor). So the kernel
is **not shift-throughput-bound** either — removing a shift does not help, and mixing shift amounts
(`>>4` alongside the `>>12` pair) actually schedules *worse* than the uniform `(s<<k)>>12` pattern
the optimizer already pairs cleanly. The real binding resource is more likely the per-chunk 16-byte
load + the two `pmullw` multiplies + the `from_i8x16` widen, which the shifts overlap with on a
wide-issue core.

**Revised conclusion for `dot_4bit_prepared`:** neither more accumulators nor fewer shifts pay. The
kernel is already near its local optimum on this SSE2-class build; the remaining lever for 4-bit
pass-1 is the **AVX2/`vpmaddubsw`-class** path (gated build-config knob, see the AVX2 section above),
not a portable source rewrite. Stop micro-tuning the `wide`-based nibble decode.

### 2026-06-27 — columnar `id` FAST field for ranked-id retrieval is SLOWER than the row store (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** the ranked-id paths (`search_doc_ids`, the hybrid lexical guard) read
each hit's `doc_id` by loading the **full stored document** (`searcher.doc(addr)`, which decompresses
the whole store block carrying id + the large `content` + title + metadata) just to extract the tiny
`id`. Classic row-store → column-store fix: mark `id` as a Tantivy string **FAST field**
(`(STRING | STORED).set_fast(None)`) and read the id from the columnar fast field, skipping the store
block. Backward-compatible (fall back to the store when the fast field is absent), and validated
**bit-identical** — `search_doc_ids_matches_counted_baseline` + all 81 lexical tests stayed GREEN,
and `reopen_preserves_documents` confirms the schema change round-trips.

**Measured (per-crate `doc_ids_topk` A/B, `rch` worker `ovh-a`, `--measurement-time 4`; `id_fast` =
columnar, `id_store` = stored-doc baseline; new arm names served as a freshness sentinel and
appeared).** Lower is faster; ratio = fast / store (>1 = fast field SLOWER):

| corpus | workload | id_store | id_fast | ratio |
|--------|----------|----------|---------|-------|
| 100k × 12-word | high_fanout | 198 µs | 457 µs | **2.30** |
| 100k × 12-word | union3 | 792 µs | 949 µs | **1.20** |
| 100k × 12-word | natural | 1.039 ms | 1.418 ms | **1.36** |
| 100k × 12-word | phrase | 1.462 ms | 1.648 ms | **1.13** |
| 20k × 400-word | high_fanout | 125 µs | 412 µs | **3.30** |
| 20k × 400-word | natural | 1.406 ms | 1.583 ms | **1.13** |

(An earlier un-hoisted version that re-opened the column **per hit** was even worse — high_fanout
3.4× — because `FastFieldReaders::str` re-deserializes the column dictionary on every call. Hoisting
the open to once-per-segment cut that to 2.3× but did not flip the sign.)

**Decision:** rejected and fully reverted (`crates/frankensearch-lexical/src/lib.rs` + bench
byte-identical to `main`; `git diff` empty before this entry — reverted via Edit, as `dcg` blocks
`git checkout -- <path>`). **Hypothesis refuted:** I expected large docs to win because store-block
decompression of big `content` should dominate — but the store stayed *faster* on the 400-word
corpus (125 µs), so the bottleneck is **not** store decompression. Root cause: `id` is a
**high-cardinality unique string** (`doc-000000`…), so its columnar dictionary is an SSTable as large
as the data, and `StrColumn::ord_to_str` pays a per-doc SSTable dictionary lookup (index walk +
dictionary-block decompress) that is *slower* than reading the small, warm LZ4 store block. Fast
fields win for **low-cardinality** columns (few distinct values → tiny dictionary), not for unique
ids.

**Route next:** do not re-attempt fast-field / columnar `doc_id` retrieval — it is corpus-independent
slower here for unique ids. If store-load is ever the proven bottleneck for big docs, the lever is a
**dedicated minimal id-only stored field** or storing the id in a numeric fast field (dense u64 →
no dictionary), not the string columnar path. Original-comparator ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meili is
N/A — this is an internal id-materialization micro-lever on the Tantivy-wrapping crate.

### 2026-06-27 — JL xorshift ILP is a real win, but original-comparator ratio is N/A (Cobaltmoth)

**Landed in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`:** `HashEmbedder::embed_jl` now interleaves `JL_LANES = 4`
independent token xorshift64 chains per dimension (ILP over a latency-bound recurrence), a
**bit-identical ~2.05× local win** (`hash_embed_jl_ilp/scalar` 102.88 µs → `ilp4` 50.19 µs;
CIs disjoint; corroborated ~1.92× on a second worker). This is recorded here only to keep the
original-comparator honesty bar: the **ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is N/A**. The `jl-*`
tier is a non-semantic hash embedder that frankensearch runs *in addition to* lexical retrieval —
it is frankensearch-internal compute the incumbents never perform, and the non-semantic fast-tier
guard already skips it on the BOLD `tantivy_doc_ids` lane. So this narrows the end-to-end gap for
jl-tier hybrid searches but is **not** a head-to-head win over a Tantivy primitive and must not be
claimed as one.

**Negative sub-result (kept):** the prior `embed_jl` branchless-sign attempt regressed because LLVM
already emits a conditional move; the `if (state & 1) == 0 { 1.0 } else { -1.0 }` form is therefore
retained in each lane. The win here is purely from breaking the single-chain shift→xor dependency,
not from the sign select. `ilp2` (~1.47×) is left in the bench as the curve point showing the gain
scales with lanes up to the shift-port limit.

### 2026-06-27 — MMR running-max + norm-hoist is a real win, but original-comparator ratio is N/A (Cobaltmoth)

**Landed in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`:** `mmr_rerank` now keeps a per-candidate running max similarity
(O(k²·n)→O(k·n) cosine evals) and hoists each embedding's L2 norm out of the pair loop (3 reductions
→ 1). Bit-identical (selection list unchanged; `incremental_norm_hoist_matches_bruteforce` GREEN);
measured **~9.3× at n100/k20 and ~23.3× at n200/k50** in-process. Recorded here only to hold the
original-comparator honesty bar: the **ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is N/A**. MMR diversity
re-ranking is a frankensearch-only stage that operates on already-retrieved candidates — it has no
counterpart in a lexical comparator's `doc_ids` path, so this narrows frankensearch's own
diversity-rerank latency rather than beating a Tantivy/Lucene/Meili primitive head-to-head. It is
also **off the default BOLD lane** (only runs when diversity rerank is enabled), so it does not move
the `hash_hybrid_tantivy_vector_rrf` rows; its value is making the MMR feature cheap when used.

### 2026-06-27 — graph-rank dense PageRank is a real win, but original-comparator ratio is N/A (Cobaltmoth)

**Landed in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`:** `GraphRanker::rank_phase1` now runs the power iteration over a
dense integer-indexed `Vec<f64>` (+ CSR edges, reused buffers) instead of rebuilding a
`HashMap<String, f64>` and clone-keying `entry()` every iteration — **~11.9× at n500/deg6 and
n2000/deg8**, ranking-equivalent (`dense_rank_matches_reference_ranking` GREEN vs a `BTreeMap`
reference of the original algorithm; the old `std::HashMap` sum order was already non-deterministic, so
nothing exact was pinned). Recorded here to hold the original-comparator honesty bar: the **ratio vs
Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is N/A**, and additionally this is behind the **off-by-default `graph`
feature**, so it does not appear in any default build or BOLD lane. Query-biased PageRank over a
document graph has no counterpart in a lexical comparator's `doc_ids` path; this makes the optional
graph-rank stage ~12× cheaper when enabled, not a head-to-head primitive win.

### 2026-06-27 — federated RRF fuse clone-elim + unstable sort is only ~1.05× — REVERTED (Cobaltmoth)

**Lever tested and reverted:** `federated::accumulate_doc` calls `docs.entry(hit.doc_id.clone())` on
every shard hit, cloning the `String` key even on the common occupied path (a doc in N shards is hit
N times, inserted once). Replaced with a `get_mut` probe (borrowed key) that only clones on a genuine
insert, and switched `into_ranked_hits` from a stable `sort_by` to `sort_unstable_by` (the comparator
is a total order via the `doc_id` tiebreak, so order-identical). Both changes are **bit-identical**.

**Measured (per-crate in-process A/B, replicas of old vs new over multi-shard input with ~60–70% doc
overlap so most accumulate calls hit the occupied path):**

| Workload (shards, hits/shard, unique docs) | old | new | ratio |
|--------------------------------------------|-----|-----|-------|
| `federated_fuse/s5_h200_u400` | 142.67 µs | 136.01 µs | **0.953 (~1.05×)** — CIs overlap |
| `federated_fuse/s10_h500_u1500` | 814.08 µs | 777.02 µs | **0.954 (~1.05×)** |

**Decision:** **reverted** (`federated.rs` + `Cargo.toml` byte-identical to `main`; bench removed).
~1.05× is marginal — the small case's CIs overlap, and federated multi-shard search is a niche,
non-default deployment mode. **Root cause the gain is small:** the doc_id key clone is only *one* of
several per-call `String` allocations — `appeared_in.insert(shard_name.to_owned())` and the
primary-update `shard_name.to_owned()` / `hit.clone()` (template) all still allocate every call and
dominate, so removing just the key clone moves ~5%. A real federated-fuse win would need to attack the
`appeared_in` `BTreeSet<String>` churn (e.g. dedup shard names to a small interned id set), not the
key clone. Original-comparator ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is **N/A** (federated cross-shard
fusion has no lexical-comparator counterpart). Do not re-attempt the key-clone/sort micro-opt alone.

### 2026-06-27 — reachable unowned compute surface is mined out; route-next handoff (Cobaltmoth)

Surveyed for a NEW clean lever after landing JL-ILP (`87892cd`), MMR running-max (`5f8b59c`), and
graph-rank dense PageRank (`9ef90fe`). **Rejected without benching** (structural reason, not a wasted
bench cycle) — recorded so the converging swarm does not re-survey these:

- **`core::l2_normalize` / `l2_normalize_in_place` multi-accumulator** — the sum-of-squares is a
  single-accumulator f32 reduction (latency-bound, not auto-vectorized), ~2–4× headroom *in isolation*.
  Rejected: **non-bit-identical** (f32 reorder) on a CORE primitive with 6 callers (every embedder +
  quantization + prf), and the absolute embed-level impact is tiny — ~0.35 µs of a 50 µs JL / 2 µs FNV
  embed. Changes every stored embedding's low bits ⇒ cross-cutting conformance risk for ~0 default-path
  gain. If ever pursued: must be a local per-embedder change with a no-golden + recall check, not a core
  edit.
- **`core::cosine_similarity` fusion/ILP** — used only by tests + the embed orthogonality test; MMR and
  index have their own cosine. Not on any hot path. No-op to optimize.
- **`fusion::prf::prf_expand`** — already auto-vectorized SAXPY (centroid + interpolate are element-wise
  slice ops); only the small norm reduction has headroom (same f32-reorder caveat). Not worth it.
- **`storage::content_hash`** — SHA-256; can't speed without changing hash semantics/collision-resistance
  (breaks the `content_hashes` dedup table). `core::fingerprint` FNV+charcount fusion already tried
  (1.002, noise — entry above).
- **`fusion::federated` BTreeSet churn** — the real lever (see entry above), but federated is a niche
  non-default mode; deprioritized.

**Where the biggest measured gap vs ORIG actually lives (owned / inherent, not a clean grab):** the BOLD
`hash_hybrid_tantivy_vector_rrf` vs `tantivy_doc_ids` residual (natural_language / short_keyword) is
bounded by **lexical query execution + ScoredResult materialization** in `frankensearch-lexical`
(`TantivyIndex::search` does a full `searcher.doc()` store read per hit) and the **int8/4-bit vector
scan** in `frankensearch-index/simd.rs` — both actively iterated by BlackThrush this session (FSVI 4-bit
`e8ec816`/`fbe177e`, doc-id top-k). The store read is shared with the incumbent and the metadata parse
is absent on the BOLD corpus, so the residual is largely *inherent hybrid overhead*, not a single-primitive
swap. Route-next for whoever owns `frankensearch-lexical`: a `LexicalSearch` trait method that returns
id+score **without** materializing the stored doc (the trait only exposes `search()` → full doc today).

### 2026-06-27 — two-term plain count-free top-k is local evidence, not original-comparator dominance (BlackThrush)

**Landed in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`:** `search_doc_ids` now extends the count-free top-k collector gate
from one plain term to one or two plain terms. This targets the current BOLD short-keyword query shape
(`rust ownership`) without reopening the previously rejected broad count-free path for phrases or
natural-language disjunctions.

**Measured local Tantivy-wrapper ratio:** `doc_ids_topk/short_keyword_bold` counted median
171.151 us → count-free median 30.900 us, ratio **0.181** (same-binary A/B, `frankensearch-lexical`,
RCH local fallback, `--profile release`, `--sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 1`).

**Ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch original comparator: N/A.** The in-repo BOLD Tantivy-class
proxy also calls this wrapper's `search_doc_ids`, so this collector choice moves the local proxy and
frankensearch's lexical candidate source together. It is valid as a local wrapper primitive and as
gap reduction for frankensearch's own lexical work, but it must not be represented as a standalone
head-to-head win over Lucene, Tantivy, or Meilisearch.

**Noisy fallback evidence from the same full bench:** fallback rows still execute the counted
collector for 3+ terms/phrases, but Criterion reported `doc_ids_topk/natural` at 698.216 us counted
vs 741.499 us through `search_doc_ids` (ratio **1.062**) while `union3` was 0.990 and phrase was
0.982. Treat the natural row as guard/measurement overhead, not a claimed win; the code deliberately
keeps 3+ term natural-language queries off the count-free collector because broad disjunctions were
already rejected in this ledger.

### 2026-06-27 — BLOCKER: `frankensearch-storage` / `frankensearch-fsfs` fail to compile (fsqlite dep skew) (Cobaltmoth)

**Blocker, not a perf result.** Any `cargo build/test/bench -p frankensearch-storage` or
`-p frankensearch-fsfs` fails at compile with:

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  fsqlite-0.1.2/src/migrate.rs:198:35
    SqliteValue::Text(Arc::from(migration.name)),
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `SmallText`, found `Arc<_, _>`
  (SqliteValue::Text(SmallText) defined in fsqlite-types-0.1.9/src/value.rs:665)
error: could not compile `fsqlite` (lib) due to 1 previous error
```

**Root cause:** the committed `Cargo.lock` pins `fsqlite 0.1.2` but `fsqlite-types 0.1.9`. Both
`crates/frankensearch-storage/Cargo.toml` and `crates/frankensearch-fsfs/Cargo.toml` declare
`fsqlite = "0.1.2"` + `fsqlite-types = "0.1.2"` (caret → `^0.1.x`), and the resolver took the latest
`fsqlite-types 0.1.9`. But `fsqlite 0.1.2`'s source uses the **old** `SqliteValue::Text(Arc<…>)` API,
while `fsqlite-types 0.1.9` changed it to `Text(SmallText)` — an upstream **breaking change inside a
`0.1.x` line** (semver violation in `fsqlite-types`). Reproduced on two RCH workers (`ovh-a`, `hz2`),
exit 101 each. **Not caused by this session** — my change did not touch `Cargo.lock`; the skew is in
the committed lock and blocks the whole `storage → fsqlite` graph (so `fsfs` too).

**Impact:** all perf work on `frankensearch-storage` and `frankensearch-fsfs` is currently un-buildable
(can't bench, can't run conformance). A clean, provably-bit-identical sniff-loop vectorization for
`fsfs::SniffFeatures::from_bytes` (per-file null/non-printable/high-bit histogram: per-byte
`u32::saturating_add` → branchless `u64` + saturate-cast, SIMD-able) was written and **reverted
unmeasured** because of this — fsfs would not compile to test or bench it.

**Fix (needs a shared-infra owner — out of scope for "git add only your own files"):** pin
`fsqlite-types` to the version `fsqlite 0.1.2` was built against, e.g. in both Cargo.tomls
`fsqlite-types = "=0.1.2"`, then `cargo update -p fsqlite-types --precise 0.1.2` to rewrite the lock;
or bump `fsqlite` to a release compatible with `fsqlite-types 0.1.9`. Until then, route perf digs to
crates outside the `storage`/`fsfs` graph.

**Follow-up (2026-06-27, Cobaltmoth): the naive fix above does NOT work — deeper diagnosis.** Attempted
the surgical lock fix; it fails because the whole `fsqlite-*` family is split, not just one crate:
- `cargo update -p fsqlite-types --precise 0.1.2` → **rejected**: `fsqlite-ext-fts5 0.1.9` (storage's
  optional `fts5`) requires `fsqlite-types ^0.1.9`; and `fsqlite-core 0.1.9` (via
  `frankensearch-durability`) also requires `^0.1.9`. So **`durability` is in the broken graph too**,
  not only storage/fsfs.
- Root cause: the **main `fsqlite` crate's latest is 0.1.2** (old `Text(Arc<…>)` API) while its
  siblings (`fsqlite-types`, `fsqlite-core`, `fsqlite-ext-fts5`, `fsqlite-vdbe`, `fsqlite-wal`, …)
  released `0.1.9+` with the breaking `Text(SmallText)` change. There is **no mixed resolution** that
  compiles: anything pulling a `0.1.9` sibling forces `fsqlite-types 0.1.9`, which `fsqlite 0.1.2`
  cannot compile against.
- A **consistent all-`0.1.2` family** IS resolvable —
  `cargo update fsqlite-types fsqlite-core fsqlite-ext-fts5 fsqlite-ext-rtree fsqlite-ext-icu
  fsqlite-wal fsqlite-planner fsqlite-pager fsqlite-btree fsqlite-mvcc fsqlite-vdbe --precise 0.1.2` —
  but it downgrades 12+ crates and **churns transitive deps** (e.g. `json5 1.3.1 → 0.4.1`, removes
  `iana-time-zone`, adds `pest`/`lru`/`sha1`/`signal-hook`), a wide blast radius that needs a **full
  workspace build** to validate (per-crate benching can't catch the collateral). Not applied here.
- **`Cargo.lock` is gitignored** (`.gitignore:5`) → it is regenerated on every clean resolve and a
  fresh resolve picks the *latest* `fsqlite-types` (already `0.1.12`). So **a committed lock cannot fix
  this** — the only durable fixes are (a) **Cargo.toml `=` pins** of the entire `fsqlite-*` family to a
  cohering version (committed, validated workspace-wide), or (b) an upstream **`fsqlite` main-crate
  0.1.9+ release** matching its siblings. Owner decision; do not lock-surgery this in the shared tree.

### 2026-06-27 — caching the lexical BM25 `QueryParser` is ~0-gain (construction is cheap) — REVERTED (Cobaltmoth)

**Lever tested and reverted:** `TantivyIndex::parse_query_lenient` (every lexical query) rebuilt a
fresh `QueryParser::for_index(...)` + `set_field_boost(...)` per call. Hypothesis: the parser is
schema-invariant, so caching it once at construction removes per-query construction cost. Implemented
(struct field built once in `from_index`) — bit-identical (81 lexical lib tests GREEN).

**Measured (per-crate in-process A/B; `rebuild` = construct parser + parse per iter, `cached` = parse
with a pre-built parser; identical `parse_query_lenient(query)` in both, so the delta is construction):**

| Workload | rebuild | cached | ratio |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| `query_parser_cache` (6-term query) | 7670.8 ns (mean 8030) | 7826.1 ns (mean 7992) | **~1.00** (CIs overlap; cached median slightly *slower*) |

**Decision:** **reverted** (`lib.rs` + `Cargo.toml` byte-identical to `main`; bench removed).
**Hypothesis refuted:** `QueryParser::for_index` construction is **cheap** (it just clones schema/field
refs + sets a boost); the ~7.8 µs is the **lenient parse itself** (tokenize → term-build → BooleanQuery),
which is identical in both arms. Caching the parser removes ~nothing.

**Route-next (the real signal here):** the lenient *parse* costs **~7.8 µs/query** — a genuine slice of
a BOLD lexical query (≈5–15 % of a 50–170 µs `tantivy_doc_ids`-class query) and pure frankensearch
per-query overhead. The win is **not** parser caching but **bypassing the full lenient `QueryParser`
for simple plain queries** — build the `BooleanQuery`/`TermQuery` AST directly (no operator/field/quote
parsing) when the query is plain tokens. This **overlaps BlackThrush's plain-query count-free top-k
path** (`search_doc_ids`, which already detects 1–2 plain terms), so it belongs to that owner: detect
plain query → skip `parse_query_lenient` → hand the collector a hand-built term query. Original-comparator
ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is **N/A** (internal Tantivy-wrapper parse overhead).

### 2026-06-27 — examined-clean inventory: reachable per-crate compute surface is saturated (Cobaltmoth)

A consolidated map of what I examined this session and found **already-optimal / owned / not-a-lever**,
so the converging swarm stops re-surveying these. Each was inspected for the usual levers (latency-bound
reductions, O(n²)/O(n) redundancy, per-iteration allocs, scalar loops missing SIMD, HashMap<String>
churn) and rejected for the stated structural reason — **no bench needed**:

- `core/cache.rs` — **S3-FIFO** (Yang et al. SOSP 2023); O(1) per access by design (freq-counter, no LRU
  list manipulation). Already the modern post-LRU algorithm.
- `core/decision_plane.rs`, `core/collectors.rs` — control-plane / telemetry, **not on the search path**.
- `core/filter.rs` — per-candidate `matches` is parsed-`Value` field lookups + `HashSet::contains`; no
  per-call alloc/parse.
- `fusion/adaptive.rs` — per-query `blend_factor`/`rrf_k` are O(1) `HashMap<QueryClass,_>` reads; updates
  are O(1) Welford. Optional + already O(1).
- `fusion/prf.rs::prf_expand` — already auto-vectorized SAXPY (element-wise centroid + interpolate); only
  the small norm reduction has headroom (f32-reorder caveat).
- `embed/cached_embedder.rs` — O(1) FIFO (not O(n) LRU); `embed/batch_coalescer.rs` —
  mutex/condvar request coordination, not a compute loop.
- `rerank/native.rs` — transformer reranker already SIMD (`f32x8` softmax) + rayon, profiling-driven
  (BlackThrush beads). Owned.
- `index`: `simd.rs`/`search.rs`/`mrl.rs`/`two_tier.rs` owned+optimized (BlackThrush); `quantization.rs`
  test-only (dead, flagged); `hnsw.rs` non-default (flagged); `wal.rs` correctness-critical+flaky
  (flagged); `vector_at_f32` f16-decode is HNSW-build/API only, not the hot scan (which uses the SIMD
  f16 dot directly).
- `lexical`: BM25 `QueryParser` construction is cheap (caching it = ~0-gain, entry above);
  `search_doc_ids` count-free top-k is BlackThrush's active path.
- `storage`/`durability`/`fsfs` — **un-buildable** (fsqlite family split, blocker entries above).

**Net state — two real moves remain, both outside a safe solo grab:**
1. **Unblock fsqlite** (owner/shared-infra) → unlocks the un-mined `storage`/`durability`/`fsfs` graph,
   which has genuine per-doc indexing compute (e.g. the ready, bit-identical `SniffFeatures::from_bytes`
   SIMD-histogram win, reverted only because fsfs won't compile).
2. **Plain-query parse bypass** in `lexical` (~5–15 % of a BOLD lexical query) — owner is the active
   `search_doc_ids` path; bit-identical *scoring* must be differentially proven vs Tantivy's parser.

Beyond these, the reachable per-crate compute surface for clean bit-identical wins is **saturated**.

### 2026-06-27 — plain-query parse bypass: ~20× faster to build but NOT rank-equivalent to Tantivy's parser — REVERTED (Cobaltmoth)

**Lever tested and reverted (the route-next from the parser-cache entry above).** `parse_query_lenient`
runs on every lexical query; for plain queries (ASCII alphanumeric + whitespace, no operators/quotes/
fields/wildcards/`AND`/`OR`/`NOT`) I built the BM25 `BooleanQuery` directly (`content:tok` + boosted
`title:tok` per token, `Should`), skipping Tantivy's lenient `QueryParser`. **Construction is hugely
cheaper** (in-process A/B, `plain_query_build`): 2-term **2855 ns → 145 ns (~19.7×)**, 4-term
**5557 ns → 357 ns (~15.6×)**.

**But it cannot be made equivalent to the parser's ranking**, across three structural attempts vs a
differential test (`plain_query_matches_parser`: build fast vs parser, search the same index, compare
ranked (BM25 score, doc_id)):
- **Flat** `Should` over all (field,token) leaves → BM25 score off by **~1 ULP** (`9.966056` vs parser
  `9.966055` on "distributed consensus algorithms") — f32 summation is **not associative**, and the
  parser's leaf grouping differs. The 81 *existing* lexical tests pass, but the 1-ULP delta **flips
  TopDocs ranking** at near-ties (score collision → DocAddress tiebreak reorders vs the parser's
  distinct scores), so it fails even a relaxed doc_id-order + ε-score check.
- **Nested** per-token (`BooleanQuery[content, title^2]` per token, outer over tokens) → scores **~3×
  off** (`8.27` vs `2.76`) — structurally wrong; Tantivy's nested `Should` scorer is not a plain sum.

**Decision:** **reverted** (`lib.rs` + `Cargo.toml` byte-identical to `main`; bench + tests removed).
The parser's exact query tree / BM25 scoring is **not externally replicable** from the public Tantivy
API, so any hand-built substitute changes ranking. Original-comparator ratio is **N/A** (Tantivy-wrapper
parse overhead). **Route-next:** a safe win needs Tantivy itself to expose a cheap plain-term query
builder that yields the parser's exact tree, or the parse cost (~3–6 µs/query, ~5–15 % of a BOLD lexical
query) must be accepted as comparator-inherent. Do not re-attempt a hand-built plain-query substitute.

### 2026-06-27 - exact-phrase underfill short-circuit is a BOLD harness semantic change, not a keep (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** changed the BOLD comparator harness so a quoted exact phrase with
any lexical hit returned lexical-only immediately, even when Tantivy returned fewer than `k` hits.
This targeted the current `top10/10000 quoted_phrase` gap, where main measured the hash-hybrid
row at **1.504x slower** than the Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class proxy (119 us incumbent,
179 us frankensearch).

**Measured command (per-crate, RCH local fallback, warm target dir):**

Artifact: `/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-b/criterion/bold_verify_phrase_candidate/summary.jsonl`.

| Workload | Candidate | Incumbent p50 | Candidate p50 | Ratio vs ORIG | Decision |
|----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| `top10/10000 quoted_phrase` | hash-hybrid | 119 us | 118 us | **0.992** | semantic change; no keep |
| `top10/10000 quoted_phrase` | lexical guard | 119 us | 119 us | **1.000** | no gain |
| `top10/100000 quoted_phrase` | hash-hybrid | 1.099 ms | 1.092 ms | **0.994** | noise/tie |
| `top10/100000 quoted_phrase` | lexical guard | 1.099 ms | 1.058 ms | **0.963** | already a guarded lexical row |
| `top10/100000 short_keyword` | hash-hybrid | 50 us | 64 us | **1.280x slower** | unrelated regression/noise |
| `top10/100000 short_keyword` | lexical guard | 50 us | 81 us | **1.620x slower** | unrelated regression/noise |
| `top10/100000 zero_hit` | hash-hybrid | 82 us | 102 us | **1.244x slower** | unrelated regression/noise |

**Why it cannot land:** the product `TwoTierSearcher` gate does not use an "any exact phrase hit"
rule. It short-circuits saturated identifier/short-keyword rows, plus a narrower non-semantic/no-
quality natural-language case. Returning fewer than `k` exact-phrase lexical hits without hybrid
backfill changes BOLD harness semantics rather than speeding the shipped search path. The best
targeted row only reached a p50 tie (0.992), while the same sweep exposed noisy slower ORIG ratios.

**Decision:** source reverted; ledger-only. Route next away from phrase underfill gates. The
remaining BOLD `limit_all` materialization gap and plain-query parse overhead have already been
routed above; do not spend another pass on exact-phrase lexical-only underfill unless product
semantics explicitly change first.

### 2026-06-27 — UPDATE: fsqlite blocker is RESOLVED by a fresh lock; cc bench pool has a rustc skew (Cobaltmoth)

**Correction to the fsqlite blocker entries above (`f9b4ee3`/`25b43f7`).** `storage`/`durability`/`fsfs`
**now compile.** The blocker was a **stale `Cargo.lock` pinning `fsqlite 0.1.2`** (whose internal code
needs the old `fsqlite-types` API) while siblings resolved to `0.1.9`. A fresh resolve
(`cargo generate-lockfile`) picks a **consistent `fsqlite 0.1.12` + `fsqlite-types 0.1.12` family** —
`fsqlite 0.1.12` exists (I'd wrongly assumed 0.1.2 was latest, reading the stale lock). Since
`Cargo.lock` is gitignored, any clean resolve gets 0.1.12. **Verified:** `cargo build -p
frankensearch-storage` compiled remotely (artifact-transfer flaked, exit 102, but the compile
succeeded), and `cargo test -p frankensearch-fsfs --lib file_classification` is **GREEN (14 passed)**.
⇒ **storage/durability/fsfs are an un-mined perf surface again** (supersedes the
[[storage-fsfs-blocked-fsqlite-family-split]] memory).

**New blocker (rch infra, not code): cc bench target POOL has a mixed-rustc skew.** `cargo bench
-p frankensearch-fsfs` (and any criterion bench) fails `error[E0514]: found crate <X> compiled by an
incompatible version of rustc` — the pool `/data/tmp/rch-targets-pool/frankensearch-cc` holds `.rmeta`
from nightly `91fe22da8` (2026-06-21) while the worker now runs `ce9954c0c` (2026-06-26), across
criterion's deps (`futures-lite`, `sharded-slab`, `thread_local`, `http`, `itoa`, `lazy_static`,
`parking`). Two attempts hit it (worker hz2); `cargo test` is unaffected (didn't need those deps).
**Fix:** `cargo clean` the cc pool (rch should invalidate the pool on toolchain change). Until then
per-crate criterion benches in the cc role are blocked.

**Ready win, bench-blocked (route-next):** `fsfs::SniffFeatures::from_bytes` per-byte `u32
saturating_add` → branchless `u64` + saturate-cast (vectorizable SIMD histogram). **Validated
bit-identical** (`sniff_features_vectorized_matches_scalar_reference` GREEN in the 14-pass run); source
reverted only because the ratio can't be measured under the pool skew. After the pool is cleaned:
`cargo bench -p frankensearch-fsfs --bench sniff_features`, then re-apply (the diff + test + bench are
recorded in this session) and land with the ratio.

**UPDATE — LANDED.** Cleared the skew with a targeted `rch exec -- cargo clean -p futures-lite
-p sharded-slab -p thread_local -p http -p itoa -p lazy_static -p parking` (rch warns
"non-compilation command" but **runs it**; removed 42 files). The bench then compiled and ran
cleanly: probe_4096 **1.4×**, probe_16384 **2.0×**, probe_65536 **2.4×** — recorded in
`docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`. Original-comparator ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is **N/A** (fsfs
file-scan layer, not a query comparator). Takeaway for the swarm: a cc-pool rustc skew (E0514) is
fixable in-band via `rch exec -- cargo clean -p <skewed crates>` — no admin needed.

### 2026-06-27 - ParsedQuery NOT-keyword allocation elision is a real local win, but ORIG ratio is N/A (BlackThrush)

**Landed in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`:** `ParsedQuery::parse` no longer allocates a three-character
`String` inside `matches_not_keyword` for each token-boundary check in negation-capable queries.
The helper now checks the fixed ASCII keyword directly (`N|n`, `O|o`, `T|t`) and preserves the
same boundary rules. Per-crate A/B through `rch exec` (local fallback, target dir
`/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-b`) measured `parsed_query/not_phrase_old` mean
**746.73 ns** versus `parsed_query/not_phrase_new` mean **668.39 ns**, ratio **0.895 (~1.12x)**.

**Ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch ORIG: N/A.** This parser is frankensearch-internal query
preprocessing for `-term` / `NOT "phrase"` exclusions before backend retrieval; the BOLD
Tantivy/Lucene/Meili-class comparator does not run an equivalent `ParsedQuery` stage. Do not claim
new ORIG dominance from it. It narrows frankensearch's own negation-query overhead and leaves the
residual BOLD materialization/parser-routing gaps documented above unchanged.

### 2026-06-27 — fsfs `count_lexical_tokens` ASCII byte fast path: original-comparator ratio N/A (Cobaltmoth)

**Landed in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`** (~1.85–2.54× on per-chunk token counting; bit-identical, 25
`lexical_pipeline` tests GREEN). Recorded here for the honesty bar: **ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meili is
N/A** — `count_lexical_tokens` is frankensearch's own fsfs file-ingest/chunking metadata pass (counts
tokens per chunk at index time); a lexical comparator runs no equivalent stage. It speeds frankensearch
indexing throughput, not a head-to-head query primitive. Second clean win in the fsfs surface that the
fsqlite stale-lock unblock reopened (after the `SniffFeatures` SIMD histogram, `08469f5`).

### 2026-06-28 — fsfs `count_lexical_tokens` fused ASCII detection is mixed/noisy — REVERTED (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted:** after the landed ASCII byte fast path, remove the up-front
`str::is_ascii()` pre-scan and fuse ASCII detection into the token-count loop. The hypothesis was
single-pass ASCII chunks would beat the current `bytes_prescan` path. This follows the graveyard
constant-factor rule: eliminate a pass only if the fused branch cost does not erase the memory-pass
win.

**Measured command** (per-crate; `rch exec` local fallback because no worker was admissible; fresh
target dir `/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a-fsfs-fused`):

```bash
AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush \
RCH_ENV_ALLOWLIST=AGENT_NAME,CARGO_TARGET_DIR,RUST_LOG \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a-fsfs-fused \
RUST_LOG=off \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-fsfs --profile release \
    --bench lexical_count -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 2
```

Criterion medians from `criterion/lexical_count/*/new/estimates.json`; ORIG is the current landed
`bytes_prescan` implementation:

| Workload | ORIG `bytes_prescan` | Candidate `bytes_fused` | Ratio vs ORIG | Decision |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------|----------|
| `lexical_count/ascii_1024` | 1478.54 ns | 2020.15 ns | **1.366x slower** | revert |
| `lexical_count/ascii_4096` | 6325.66 ns | 4212.20 ns | 0.666 | win row only |
| `lexical_count/ascii_16384` | 13468.65 ns | 15171.09 ns | **1.126x slower** | revert |

**Decision:** source and bench changes were reverted. The fused loop is not a clean keep: it regresses
the near-default chunk shape (fsfs `LexicalChunkPolicy::default().max_chars` is 768, closest to the
1 KiB row) and large chunks, while the 4 KiB row alone is not enough to justify a length-threshold
policy. Ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is **N/A** for this isolated file-ingest token-counting
primitive; it does not move the BOLD query comparator.

### 2026-06-27 - fsfs `code_structure_sidecar::tokenize` ASCII fast path: ORIG ratio N/A and 256-byte tie (BlackThrush)

**Landed in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`** for medium/larger code-structure sidecar tokenization:
`code_tokenize/ascii_1024` ratio **0.640 (~1.56x)** and `code_tokenize/ascii_4096` ratio
**0.545 (~1.84x)**, measured per-crate with
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-b rch exec -- cargo bench
-p frankensearch-fsfs --profile release --bench code_tokenize -- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1
--measurement-time 2`.

Honesty notes: **ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch ORIG is N/A** because this is frankensearch's
fsfs code-structure sidecar tokenizer, not a comparator query primitive. The small-string row
`code_tokenize/ascii_256` measured **5011.625 ns -> 4976.335 ns, ratio 0.993**, which is a noise/tie
and must not be cited as a win. The lever is kept only for the larger-snippet rows where the measured
ratio is below the 0.97 keep threshold.

### 2026-06-28 — blend_two_tier `sort_by` → `sort_unstable_by` is ~0-gain — REVERTED (Cobaltmoth)

**Lever tested and reverted.** `blend_two_tier` (the default sync hybrid path, `sync_searcher.rs`)
finalizes by sorting merged candidates with a strict total-order comparator (score desc, then unique
`doc_id`), so `sort_by` → `sort_unstable_by` is order-identical (bit-identical) and skips the
stable-sort scratch alloc. Benched the full blend (bounds + `AHashMap` merge + collect + sort), stable
vs unstable, at realistic fast+quality candidate counts:

| Workload | stable | unstable | ratio |
|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| `blend_sort/n60` | 13553 ns | 13004 ns | **0.959 (~1.04×)** |
| `blend_sort/n200` | 44925 ns | 43296 ns | **0.964 (~1.04×)** |
| `blend_sort/n500` | 113990 ns | 115604 ns | **1.014 (~0.99×, slightly slower)** |

**Decision:** **reverted** (`blend.rs` + `Cargo.toml` byte-identical to `main`, bench removed). ~1.04×
at small/medium n, neutral at n500 — the sort is a small fraction of blend (which is dominated by the
`AHashMap` build + per-doc `to_owned`), so the unstable-sort saving doesn't move the function. This
**confirms the earlier federated `sort_unstable` finding**: `sort_by`→`sort_unstable_by` on these
candidate-count (tens–hundreds) total-order sorts is consistently ~0-gain. Do not re-attempt
`sort_unstable` micro-opts on fusion candidate sorts. Original-comparator ratio is **N/A** (internal
fusion finalization).

### 2026-06-28 — durability `codec.rs` is a round-robin COPY stub, not GF erasure coding — no SIMD lever (Cobaltmoth)

**Not attempted — flagged to save the erasure-coding rabbit hole.** `RaptorqCodec::encode`
(`crates/frankensearch-durability/src/codec.rs`) *looks* like a Reed-Solomon/fountain codec (the
alien-graveyard "erasure coding → SIMD the GF(256) multiply" lever), but its repair symbols are just
**round-robin copies of source symbols**: `repair_symbols.push((esi, source_symbols[repair_idx %
k_source].1.clone()))` — there is **no GF(256) multiply and no XOR parity** to vectorize, only a
`Vec<u8>` clone per repair symbol (memcpy, allocation-bound, not compute-bound). Optimizing it would be
a zero-impact change. The rest of `frankensearch-durability` is crc32 (already SIMD via `crc32fast`) +
file I/O; **no compute lever exists in the durability crate.** If a real erasure codec is wired later
(actual GF math), re-evaluate then. Original-comparator ratio is **N/A** (internal durability codec).

### 2026-06-28 — storage write path already batch-optimal; storage/durability indexing surface mapped lever-free (Cobaltmoth)

**Not attempted — verified already-optimal.** The classic SQLite indexing lever (per-row commits →
batch into one transaction, often 10–100×) **does not apply**: `DocumentStore::upsert_batch`
(`crates/frankensearch-storage/src/document.rs`) already wraps the whole batch in a **single**
`self.transaction(|conn| { for doc in docs { upsert_document_with_outcome(conn, doc) } })`; single-doc
`upsert` uses one transaction (correct). No per-doc commit/fsync antipattern. The rest of the write
path is prepared-statement SQL + serde serialization (inherent). Combined with the durability-codec
copy-stub finding (entry above) and the `storage`/`pipeline.rs` scan (orchestration, no byte loops),
the **fsqlite-reopened storage + durability indexing surface is fully mapped as lever-free** for clean
per-crate compute wins. Original-comparator ratio is **N/A** (internal indexing/write path).

### 2026-06-28 — sync rank-change clone-elision is a real ~2× local win, original-comparator ratio N/A (Cobaltmoth)

**Landed in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`:** `compute_rank_changes_for_scored` (every sync hybrid query) no
longer clones every `doc_id` into two throwaway `Vec<VectorHit>` to build its rank maps — it borrows
`doc_id.as_str()` straight from the `ScoredResult` slices (`build_borrowed_rank_map` only ever read
`doc_id`). **~1.98–2.26×** on the rank-map build (bit-identical `RankChanges`; 6 sync_searcher tests
GREEN). Recorded here to hold the honesty bar: the **ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is N/A** —
rank-change telemetry (initial-vs-refined promotion/demotion counts) is a frankensearch-only
observability stage with no comparator counterpart; this trims frankensearch's own per-query overhead,
it is not a head-to-head primitive win. (Counters the earlier "surface is saturated" notes: a genuine
default-path clone-elision lever remained in the sync result-assembly path.)

### 2026-06-28 — sync vector score-map borrow is a real ~2.4–2.8× local win, original-comparator ratio N/A (Cobaltmoth)

**Landed in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`:** the no-lexical sync branch's per-query `fast_scores`/`quality_scores`
maps now key on `&str` borrowed from the candidate hits instead of cloned `String` (they were only
`.get()`-looked-up by `&str`). **~2.37–2.77×** on the two-map build (bit-identical; 6 sync_searcher tests
GREEN). Honesty bar: **ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is N/A** — this is frankensearch's own
pure-vector result-assembly bookkeeping (no lexical comparator counterpart), and it's the **no-lexical**
path (the BOLD lexical lane uses `rrf_fuse`, unaffected). Confirms the orchestration/result-assembly
clone-elision vein is productive (2 wins now: `rank_map` `f8f645e`, this).

### 2026-06-28 — sync lexical fused-materialize move is a real ~7.8–21.5× local win, original-comparator ratio N/A (Cobaltmoth)

**Landed in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`:** `fused_hits_to_scored_results` now takes the `rrf_fuse` result by
value and **moves** each `doc_id` into the `ScoredResult` instead of cloning it (the `FusedHit`s are a
fresh temporary). **~7.76–21.55×** on the materialization (bit-identical; 6 sync_searcher tests GREEN) —
larger than the map wins because it drops both the per-result clone (N allocs) and the temporary's
string drops (N frees). Honesty bar: **ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is N/A** — this is
frankensearch's own hybrid result-assembly, the absolute time is one small query step, and the headline
ratio is on that step in isolation (not end-to-end). Third clone-elision win in the sync result-assembly
vein (`rank_map` `f8f645e`, `score_map` `dc86170`, this). Note the **async `searcher.rs` already** uses
borrow-keyed score maps + clone-free rank maps — that path was the optimized reference; these three wins
brought the sync searcher to parity.

### 2026-06-28 — sync vector refined materialize move is a real ~1.4–2.5× local win, original-comparator ratio N/A (BlackThrush)

**Landed in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`:** the no-lexical sync refined branch now consumes the owned
`blend_two_tier` output and moves each unique `doc_id` into the final `ScoredResult` instead of routing
through the generic borrowed vector converter (`HashSet` dedup + `String` clone). Measured ratios vs
the old in-process converter: `n20` **0.537**, `n60` **0.724**, `n200` **0.406** (bit-identical;
`blend_two_tier` output is already unique). Honesty bar: **ratio vs Lucene/Tantivy/Meilisearch is N/A**
because this is frankensearch's own pure-vector result-assembly bookkeeping, not a comparator query
primitive.

### 2026-06-28 — sync `search_collect` phase-clone elision is sub-noise on the end-to-end path (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted.** `SyncTwoTierSearcher::search_internal` always builds the streaming
`phases` (`SearchPhase::Initial` + `SearchPhase::Refined`, each cloning the full
`Vec<ScoredResult>`, plus a `RankChanges` clone into `metrics`), but `search_collect` —
the hot production/BOLD path (`search_collect → search_collect_with_filter`) — returns only
`(final_results, metrics)` and **discards `outcome.phases` entirely**. (The async reference
`searcher.rs` extracts its results *from* the phases via the `on_phase` callback, so it never
double-builds; the sync path uniquely builds both a phase copy and a separate `final_results`.)
Hypothesis: thread a `want_phases` flag through `search_internal` so `search_collect` (false) skips
the discarded phase clones while `search_iter` (true) keeps them. Correctness-neutral: `final_results`
and `metrics` (incl. `rank_changes`, now *moved* into `metrics` on the collect path instead of cloned)
are bit-identical; all 6 `sync_searcher` tests GREEN (both the collect and iter paths).

**Measured (same-binary A/B via a `#[doc(hidden)] search_collect_with_phases_baseline` that forces
`want_phases=true` then discards the phases = old behavior; small two-tier index N=4000/dim=64 so the
int8 fast-tier scan doesn't swamp the orchestration; per-crate, RCH `hz2`, `--profile release`;
`baseline` = build+discard phases, `candidate` = skip; medians, two runs):**

| Workload | baseline | candidate | ratio (run 2 / run 1) |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------------------|
| `sync_collect_phases/k10`  | 207.03 µs | 193.86 µs | **0.936 / 0.920** |
| `sync_collect_phases/k64`  | 638.26 µs | 628.86 µs | 0.985 / **1.029 (slower)** |
| `sync_collect_phases/k256` | 1.1143 ms | 1.1229 ms | **1.008 (slower)** / 1.013 |

Command:
```bash
AGENT_NAME=BlackThrush RCH_ENV_ALLOWLIST=AGENT_NAME,CARGO_TARGET_DIR,RUST_LOG \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/search-cc RUST_LOG=off \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-fusion --profile release \
  --bench sync_collect_phases -- --sample-size 80 --warm-up-time 2 --measurement-time 4
```

**Decision: reverted** (source + `Cargo.toml` + bench byte-identical to `main`; only this entry
remains). The candidate does *strictly less* work (it removes provably-discarded clones), yet the
k256 arm measured it **slower** (1.008/1.013) and the k64 arm **sign-flipped** between the two runs —
the saving is below the bench noise floor everywhere except a reproducible-but-CI-overlapping ~6% at
**k10** (baseline `[194.24, 221.69]` vs candidate `[182.77, 205.18]`). The phase clones are a fixed
~10–13 µs (≈`2·k` `ScoredResult` clones + one `RankChanges`); end-to-end `search_collect` is dominated
by the int8 fast-tier scan + quality scoring + `blend_two_tier` + the two *unavoidable* materializers,
so on a realistic 100k corpus (BOLD top10 ≈645 µs, int8 scan even heavier) that fixed saving is well
under noise. This mirrors the earlier `doc_id`-cache reject (sync orchestration overhead is a small
slice at realistic `k`) — the measurable orchestration clones were already captured by the landed
`rank_map`/`score_map`/`fused_materialize`/`vector_materialize` wins; the residual phase clones don't
clear the 0.97 keep threshold and the `want_phases` flag + baseline-method complexity isn't justified
by a measured gain. Original-comparator ratio is **N/A** (internal sync result-assembly).

**Route next:** stop probing the sync result-assembly/orchestration clone-elision vein for end-to-end
wins — it is mined to the noise floor. Any future attempt here must isolate a *per-function* micro-bench
(as the landed map/materialize wins did) AND show the function is a non-trivial slice of the real path,
not just a clean ratio in isolation.

### 2026-06-28 — BOLD comparator is empirically CLOSED; `limit_all` is the lone (inherent) gap (BlackThrush)

**Empirical re-measurement, not a lever.** Ran the live `bold_verify_tantivy_class` comparator
(`-p frankensearch --features lexical`, 10-sample p50, RCH `hz2`) to find the *current* biggest gap
vs the Tantivy/Lucene-class proxy rather than trust stale ledger numbers. After the accumulated wins
(id materialization 6.32×, zero-hit/lexical-saturated short-circuits, int8/4-bit fast tier, RRF
select_nth, clone-elisions), the comparator is **parity-or-better on every top-k row** — the
2026-06-27 gaps are gone:

| corpus | query_class | hash_hybrid ratio (fs/incumbent) | was (2026-06-27) |
|--------|-------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| 10k  | short_keyword    | **0.860** | — |
| 10k  | quoted_phrase    | **0.912** | 1.459× slower |

**Decision: no clean new per-crate comparator lever exists.** The only robustly-slower row is
**`limit_all`** (return *everything*), and its gap is **inherent to hybrid semantics**: the challenger
must embed the query, scan the *entire* vector tier (candidate_limit = doc_count, so the int8/4-bit
two-pass can't prune — you need all vectors), and RRF-fuse + full-sort ~2·N candidates, where the
incumbent does lexical-only. There is no bit-identical way to remove that work without changing
results (e.g. skipping semantic re-rank for `limit_all` would alter ordering). `exact_identifier/100k`
(1.082 p50) is sample noise (p95 0.565, the challenger faster). **The perf swarm's comparator mission
is essentially accomplished — stop hunting comparator-ratio levers.**

**Route next (real-world, NOT comparator-measurable):** the one remaining concrete perf item is the
**on-`open` ord-table rebuild** for persisted on-disk indexes (PERF_LEDGER 2026-06-28 wiring entry):
reopened on-disk indexes currently fall back to docstore id-materialization until the table is rebuilt,
so they miss the 6.32× win the in-memory path already has. Options: (a) one-pass docstore scan at
`open` (O(N) decompress, simplest-correct, ~0.4 µs/doc ⇒ ~40 ms at 100k), or (b) persist the table to a
sidecar on `commit` + load on `open` (no scan, but needs a file format + atomicity + corruption
fallback). This benefits real persisted deployments but does NOT move the in-memory BOLD comparator.

### 2026-06-28 — `index_documents` per-batch ord-table lock hoist is ~0-gain (within noise) (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and reverted.** The materialization wiring appends each doc's `doc_id` to the ord table
at index time; `index_documents` did this via `assign_ord` (which re-locks `ord_table.write()` **per
doc**). Hypothesis: a bulk index should hold the table write lock **once** for the whole batch (and
`reserve(docs.len())` up front), paying one lock + one growth instead of N — verifying the
materialization win didn't regress indexing throughput (a real Tantivy/Lucene comparator dimension).
Correctness-neutral (the ord assignment is identical, just the lock scope differs): 82/82 lexical tests
GREEN with the batch-lock path.

**Measured (per-crate same-binary A/B, fresh in-memory index per iteration, N=5000 docs, 20 samples;
`per_doc_lock` = old `assign_ord`-per-doc, `batch_lock` = lock-once + reserve):**

| Workload | per_doc_lock | batch_lock | Ratio |
|----------|--------------|------------|-------|
| `batch_index` (index 5000 docs) | 21.547 ms `[19.073, 25.007]` | 20.038 ms `[19.659, 20.458]` | **0.93 (CIs overlap)** |

**Decision: reverted** (source + `Cargo.toml` byte-identical to `main`, baseline method + bench removed).
The 0.93 median is **noise, not signal**: the `per_doc_lock` arm's CI is very wide `[19.073, 25.007]`
(allocation/scheduling spikes) and its lower bound sits below the `batch_lock` median, while the true
lock effect is only ~0.7% (≈`5000 × ~30 ns` uncontended `RwLock` ops over a ~20 ms index). Indexing is
dominated by Tantivy `add_document` (tokenization + postings + stored doc) plus the **inherent** per-doc
`doc_id` clone the table requires — neither removable by lock scope. **The materialization win's
index-time overhead is negligible and not lock-bound; there is no clean indexing lever here.** Confirms
the materialization win is a good trade (6.32× query-time materialization for sub-noise index cost).
Don't re-attempt index-path micro-opts on the ord-table append. Original-comparator ratio is **N/A**
(frankensearch's own index-time bookkeeping; raw Tantivy is the floor the wrapper sits above).

### 2026-06-28 — async `searcher.rs` per-query path is now well-mined; remaining clones are structural/invasive or amortized (BlackThrush)

**Full code-level audit, no clean lever found.** After the two async-`searcher.rs` clone-elision wins
(`cba06d7` lexical-metadata map borrow 3.55–7.20×; `2b7ad34` MMR reorder move 25–75×), I audited the
rest of the async `TwoTierSearcher` per-query path for the same pattern. Everything else is either
already optimal or NOT a clean win — these are **code/lifetime facts, not bench-measurable**:

- **Score/rank maps** (`searcher.rs` ~1421–1462): already `AHashMap<&str, &ScoredResult>` / `<&str, f32>`
  (borrow-keyed, copy values). `build_borrowed_rank_map` is clone-free. **Optimal.**
- **`kendall_tau_with_refined_rank`** (`blend.rs` 253): already **O(n log n)** (merge-sort inversion
  counting), documented. One small scratch `Vec` per call (n≈30) — sub-noise. **Optimal.**
- **`graph_rank`** (`graph_rank.rs` 86–235, conditional): already an **index-based** CSR power iteration
  (the hot loop uses `usize` indices, not `HashMap` lookups); boundary `doc_id.clone()`s are structural
  (`HashMap<GraphDocId,…>` owned keys) and it only runs when a `DocumentGraph` is configured. **Optimal.**
- **`fast_hits` / `quality_hits` doc_id clones** (`searcher.rs` 1358, 1382, every refined query): these
  clone `doc_id` from `initial_results` → `fast_hits` → `quality_hits`. **Structural**: `VectorHit` owns
  `doc_id: String`, and `blend_two_tier(&fast_hits, &quality_hits, …)` needs both vecs live
  simultaneously, so neither can borrow/move from the other or from `initial_results` (which `initial_by_doc`
  borrows through the final assembly). Eliding requires giving `VectorHit` a borrowed `doc_id` — a
  **core-type lifetime change with a wide blast radius** across `frankensearch-index` + `-fusion` + the
  FSVI path. Flagged invasive in [[fusion-sync-result-assembly-clone-elision]] (sync `quality_hits` rebuild).
- **Phase clones** (`display_hits.clone()` / `refined_results.clone()` into `on_phase(SearchPhase::…)`):
  **streaming-necessary** — the `on_phase` callback consumes each phase while the search continues
  mutating `results`, so the phase needs its own owned copy.
- **`display_hits = initial_hits.iter().take(k).cloned()`** (~516): NOT redundant — `initial_hits` is
  reused at lines 573/648/819 (phase-2 refinement borrows the full set), so the top-k must be copied out.
  k≈10, sub-noise regardless (cf. the reverted sync phase-clone elision).
- **Quantization slab build** (`in_memory.rs` `quantize_i8_slab` / `pack_4bit_slab`): a real scalar
  compute kernel (`round()` per element may block autovectorization), **but amortized** — built once via
  `OnceLock` (`get_or_init`, lines 408/516) and cached, so it is a **cold-start / index-build** cost, not
  a steady-state query gap, and not "vs Lucene/Tantivy" (no incumbent vector tier).
- **MMR cosine dot** (`mmr.rs` `cosine_sim_pre`): scalar f64; SIMD/f32 would **change rounding**
  (not bit-identical → could shift MMR selection) and it is a conditional (opt-in) path.

**Conclusion:** the steady-state async per-query paths are **comprehensively optimized**; no clean new
per-crate lever remains without an **invasive `VectorHit` borrow refactor** (the one real remaining
per-query opportunity — eliminates the `fast_hits`/`quality_hits` doc_id double-clone, ~60–200 small
`String` clones/refined query — but needs a dedicated, well-tested change across index+fusion, not a
60-min dig). Original-comparator ratio **N/A** (async result-assembly the BOLD harness doesn't model).
Combined with [[bold-comparator-closed]] (comparator closed, limit_all inherent) and the indexing-axis
clear: **stop re-scanning the query/result-assembly surface — the next real work is the scoped VectorHit
refactor or a genuinely new subsystem.**

## 2026-06-28 — Non-index compute subsystems (MMR cosine, embed L2-normalize, graph_rank) — explored, NOT clean levers (BlackThrush)

After the `frankensearch-index` SIMD vein was capped (all 6 dot kernels + int8/4-bit slab quantizers +
f16 encode + the file-based FSVI slab write — see PERF_LEDGER, `bce9bc8`→`2a4d333`), I dug the
**non-index** subsystems the alien-graveyard flagged (`frankensearch-embed` HashEmbedder,
`frankensearch-fusion` MMR/graph_rank, `frankensearch-rerank`). None yields a clean
bit-identical, default-path, per-crate lever:

- **MMR `cosine_sim_pre` (`fusion/src/mmr.rs:285`)** — the O(k·n) pairwise-similarity hot kernel. It is
  ALREADY norm-hoisted (each candidate's L2 norm computed once, not per pair) and running-max optimized
  (O(k·n) not O(k²·n)) by prior cycles; the residual work is the per-pair dot, which accumulates
  **sequentially in `f64`** (`dot += f64::from(a[i]) * f64::from(b[i])`). A SIMD/multi-accumulator dot
  reorders the f64 adds → results differ by ULPs → can **flip the greedy-argmax selection** against the
  bit-exact reference test (`mmr_rerank_reference`). f64 add is non-associative, so there is no
  order-preserving SIMD form (unlike the index f16/f32 dots, whose *generic was already a `wide` kernel*
  I could match lane-for-lane). **AND MMR is opt-in** (`MmrConfig`, not wired into the default/BOLD
  hybrid). Two strikes: bit-identical-blocked + off-default.

- **`l2_normalize_in_place` (`core/src/traits.rs:376`)** — the 2-pass (Σx² + scale) L2 normalize shared
  by every embedder, run per embed (index-time docs + each query). The scalar `iter().map(x*x).sum()` IS
  latency-bound (Rust doesn't fast-math-vectorize f32 reductions → a single serialized accumulator), so a
  multi-accumulator form is a real ~2-4× **on the kernel**. BUT: (1) `frankensearch-core` has **no SIMD
  dep** (`wide` absent) — adding SIMD/AVX2-dispatch to the base crate for this is disproportionate; (2)
  the `l2_normalize_in_place_matches_allocating` test asserts **bit-exact** equality to the allocating
  variant (small cases pass via the scalar tail, but the contract is bit-exact); (3) reordering Σx²
  changes embedding values by ULPs that **ripple through f16 quantization + vector scoring** → would need
  slow **full-workspace** verification (parking risk) to prove no downstream ranking regression — for a
  modest gain on a kernel the FNV/JL hashing (and, for short queries, the rest of the query) already
  dominates. Poor risk/reward; left scalar (REVERT-territory per "REVERT ~0-gain").

- **`graph_rank` (`fusion/src/graph_rank.rs`)** — PageRank-style power iteration over a **sparse** HashMap
  adjacency (`for _ in 0..max_iterations { for src in 0..n { …edges… } }`). Sparse, pointer-chasing,
  data-dependent — not a SIMD/dense-matrix shape — and opt-in (`GraphRanker`, off-default). No lever.

**Conclusion:** the **clean per-crate compute surface is comprehensively optimized** — index dots +
quantizers + f16 encode + file-write all AVX2/F16C-dispatched (bit-identical); comparator closed
([[bold-comparator-closed]]); materialization + async result-assembly mined. The remaining
float-accumulation kernels are **bit-identical-blocked** (sequential f32/f64, non-associative) and/or
**off the default path**, so they are not safe 60-min levers. Original-comparator ratio **N/A** for all
three (own vector/rerank tiers; no Tantivy counterpart). **Next real work is the standing open item:
re-measure BOLD on a QUIET worker** to confirm the SIMD/build arc's comparator impact (the `frankensearch`
top-level crate is a cold/slow build — must not re-park it under contention), or accept the current
(comprehensively optimized) state. Don't re-dig MMR/normalize/graph_rank without lifting the
bit-identical or off-default constraint first.

---

## 2026-06-28 — BOLD re-measured: comparator NOT fully closed — two real gaps remain (exact_identifier@100k, limit_all) (BlackThrush)

**Did the open item.** Built + ran `bold_verify_tantivy_class` (`-p frankensearch --features lexical`)
**locally + niced** (the 5 contending procs were OTHER projects on the shared rch workers, so a local
nice'd build dodged the stuck-queue that killed prior attempts). Fast criterion settings from the bench's
own documented command (`--sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 3`). Emit:
`FRANKENSEARCH_BOLD_VERIFY_EMIT=1`. **ratio = frankensearch_p50 / incumbent(Tantivy-class)_p50; >1 means
frankensearch SLOWER.** corpus hashes `2e78365a…`(10k) / `13f1b015…`(100k).

**frankensearch hybrid (`hash_hybrid_tantivy_vector_rrf`) p50 ratios:**

| query_class | 10k | 100k | reliability |
|-------------|-----|------|-------------|
| exact_identifier | 0.927 ✅ | **1.425 ❌** | 100k reliable (619→882 µs) |
| short_keyword | 1.200 ❓ | 1.020 ≈ | 10k NOISE (30 µs workload, p99 4.2× = spike) |
| quoted_phrase | 0.940 ✅ | **0.728 ✅** | reliable |
| natural_language | 0.654 ✅ | **0.792 ✅** | reliable |
| high_fanout | 1.049 ≈ | **0.789 ✅** | 100k reliable |
| zero_hit | 0.950 ✅ | 0.853 ✅ | tiny (~20-30 µs) |
| limit_all | **1.390 ❌** | (not benched @100k) | reliable (1376→1913 µs) |

**Conclusion — CORRECTS the stale [[bold-comparator-closed]] "parity-or-better on every row" claim.**
frankensearch hybrid is **faster than the Tantivy-class incumbent on most classes** (quoted_phrase 0.73,
natural_language 0.79, high_fanout 0.79 @100k; exact_identifier 0.93 @10k) — but **two real gaps survive
the entire SIMD/build arc**:

1. **`exact_identifier` @ 100k: 1.425×** (incumbent 619 µs → frankensearch 882 µs). The canonical
   "non-short-circuit row pays vector+RRF on top of lexical" gap: for a unique-token match the lexical
   tier alone nails it, but the hybrid still scans the vector tier + fuses RRF (~+263 µs of pure
   overhead). Notably the **`hash_lexical_guard` variant is EVEN SLOWER here (1.895×, 619→1173 µs)** — so
   the existing short-circuit guard is NOT helping for exact_identifier@100k (it adds cost without
   skipping). **This is the next dig target** (algorithmic, not a SIMD kernel): make the lexical guard
   actually short-circuit (skip vector+RRF) on a high-confidence exact lexical match, or find why the
   guard path is slow at 100k.
2. **`limit_all`: ~1.39×** (materialization-bound; "inherent" per prior notes — per-hit full stored-doc
   materialization the incumbent doesn't pay the same way).

**Strategic takeaway:** the SIMD/build wins this session (dots, quantizers, f16 encode, FSVI write) are
real **build/load-time** wins but did NOT move these **query-time** gaps — because the gaps are
**algorithmic** (redundant vector+RRF work on lexical-sufficient queries) and **materialization**, not
dot-kernel-bound. The next real lever is the **exact_identifier short-circuit** (the lexical-guard path),
not more compute-kernel SIMD. Caveat: fast settings → small-workload ratios (short_keyword, zero_hit)
are noise; trust the ≥600 µs workloads. (The bench only runs `limit_all` at 10k — there is no 100k
`limit_all` row. Full run completed; final summary = 26 rows.)

> **⚠️ SELF-CORRECTION (same day, second run — supersedes the `exact_identifier@100k` claim above):
> that "1.425× gap" was 12-SAMPLE NOISE, not real.** See the next entry.

## 2026-06-28 — BOLD re-run #2: the exact_identifier@100k "gap" was NOISE — comparator is top-k PARITY, limit_all the lone gap (BlackThrush)

Immediately suspicious that the `exact_identifier@100k` "gap" (run #1: hybrid 1.425×, **guard 1.895×**)
was noise — because `hash_lexical_guard` runs the *identical* `fixture.lexical.search_doc_ids(...)` as the
incumbent, so it CANNOT be 1.9× slower except by measurement variance. The bench's summary uses the custom
`measure_latency_us` with only **12 samples @100k / 25 @10k** (NOT criterion's `--sample-size`), so per-row
ratios carry ±40% noise. Code analysis confirms the mechanism: `exact_identifier = "doc 000042"`, and
"doc" appears in every doc → lexical returns ≥`limit` hits → `bold_verify_lexical_short_circuit` fires
(class ∈ {Identifier,…}, `lexical_count ≥ limit`) → **the hybrid SHORT-CIRCUITS and skips the vector tier
entirely** → it should ≈ the incumbent.

**Re-ran the cached binary (run #2, low contention). Result — the gap vanished:**

| query_class | run #1 ratio | run #2 ratio | verdict |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------|
| exact_identifier @100k (hybrid) | 1.425 | **1.003** | NOISE — parity |
| exact_identifier @100k (guard) | 1.895 | **1.002** | NOISE — parity |
| quoted_phrase @100k | 0.728 | 1.004 | NOISE — parity (run#1 "win" was also noise) |
| natural_language @100k | 0.792 | 1.002 | NOISE — parity |
| high_fanout @100k | 0.789 | 0.992 | parity |
| **limit_all @10k** | **1.390** | **1.429** | **REAL — consistent across runs** |

The tell: frankensearch hybrid was *consistent* run-to-run (exact_id@100k 882→884 µs); the **incumbent**
swung 619→881 µs — i.e. run #1's incumbent measured anomalously LOW, inflating every run-#1 ratio (both
the apparent gaps AND the apparent wins). **Run #2 shows frankensearch hybrid at PARITY (±6%) on EVERY
top-10 class at both 10k and 100k**, faster on zero_hit + natural_language@10k. **The only gap consistent
across both runs is `limit_all` (~1.4×), which is inherent** (returns everything → full vector-tier scan,
can't prune; RRF full-sort of ~2·N; the incumbent does lexical-only) — no bit-identical removal, per
[[bold-comparator-closed]].

**Conclusion (re-affirms the ORIGINAL "comparator closed" finding; my own run-#1 "exact_identifier gap"
was a phantom):** the BOLD comparator is **top-k parity across all classes + corpus sizes**; `limit_all`
~1.4× is the lone, inherent gap. **There is NO exact_identifier short-circuit lever to dig** (the
short-circuit already fires and works). **Lesson:** at the fast settings (12/25 samples) a SINGLE run's
per-row ratios are ±40% noise — never conclude a gap (or a win) from one run; require run-to-run
consistency, and treat the *incumbent's* variance as the dominant noise source. Don't re-chase
exact_identifier or the 100k "wins"; `limit_all` remains the only real (inherent) row.

## 2026-06-28 — Production search orchestration (sync_searcher + fsfs runtime) — verified-mined, no clean lever (BlackThrush)

After the InMemory full-recall short-cut (`84fbfa2`), applied that same "find redundant work" lens to the
**production** search paths (not the BOLD bench proxy). Both are already optimal; the remaining candidates
are sub-noise or result-changing:

- **`fusion/sync_searcher.rs` (the wired sync hybrid):** flow is tight — the quality tier
  `quality_scores_for_hits(query, &fast_hits)` rescores ONLY the fast candidates (no re-scan);
  `blend_two_tier` keys an `AHashMap<&str, _>` by `doc_id.as_str()` (borrowed, no clone); RRF is mined.
  The lone remaining per-query alloc is `quality_hits` cloning each `fast_hit.doc_id` (line ~224) just to
  pair it with the rescored value. It IS elidable bit-identically (a `blend_two_tier_with_quality_scores`
  variant taking `(&fast_hits, &[Option<f32>])` would merge by the same borrowed `&str` key — `quality_hits`
  is a doc_id-identical subset of `fast_hits`, so the merged map + `blended` are byte-for-byte the same).
  BUT it's **provably sub-noise**: `fetch` (≈k·over-fetch ≈ 30–100) small `String` allocs against the
  `sync_int8_fetch` bench's **100k-vector** scan that dominates end-to-end latency → ~0-gain (REVERT per
  the directive). Not the same class as the async metadata-map win (`cba06d7`, which elided ~candidate-count
  `serde_json::Value` clones, far heavier than short doc_id strings). Left as-is.

- **`fsfs/runtime.rs` semantic (6466) + quality (6577) stages — NOT a redundant double-scan:** both call
  `resources.vector_index.search_top_k(...)`, but the semantic stage embeds with `fast_embedder` and the
  quality stage with **`quality_embedder`** (a distinct model) → *different query vectors* over the same
  index = legitimate two-tier reranking, not redundant. (The query embed IS recomputed per stage, but
  they're different embedders.) The one arguable inefficiency — the quality stage doing a FULL
  `search_top_k(quality_budget)` rather than rescoring the semantic candidates (as `sync_searcher` does) —
  is **result-changing** (a full scan can surface docs the semantic stage missed), so it's a design choice,
  not a bit-identical lever; not a 60-min dig.

**Conclusion:** the production search orchestration is **verified-mined**. Combined with the closed BOLD
comparator (top-k parity, `limit_all` inherent), the comprehensively-AVX2/F16C-mined index compute, the
InMemory full-recall short-cut, and the rejected non-index kernels (MMR/normalize/graph_rank), **no clean,
bit-identical, above-noise per-crate perf lever remains.** The genuine remaining opportunities are either
**invasive** (a `VectorHit<'a>` lifetime refactor across index+fusion to kill the doc_id clones wholesale)
or **result-changing** (aggressive exact_identifier short-circuit, fsfs quality-rescore, limit_all tail
approximation) — none fits the "60-min, bit-identical, conformance-GREEN, measured-ratio" bar.

## 2026-06-28 — f16 dot 4-accumulator latency-unlock: REFUTED (~0-gain — decode-throughput-bound, not add-latency-bound) (BlackThrush)

The JL 8-lane win (`abd4628`) came from a latency unlock — the 4-lane xorshift was a single-register
dependency chain, so a 2nd accumulator register hid the latency. Its lesson said "re-check the other
dependency-chain kernels." I did. The **f16-bytes dot** (`dot_product_f16_bytes_f32_avx2`, the DEFAULT
vector-tier kernel) uses a single `__m256` accumulator — `sum = add_ps(sum, mul_ps(cvtph(..), q))` — and
`add_ps` has ~4-cycle latency while `cvtph_ps` pipelines at ~1/cycle, so I hypothesised it was
**add-latency-bound** (a ~4× latent win behind a 4-accumulator rewrite, the biggest default-path kernel).

**MEASURED first (a non-production 4-acc variant + bench arm, since a 4-acc reduction is NOT
bit-identical):**

| `dot/dim256/f16_bytes` (10k vecs) | 1-acc (prod) | 4-acc | Ratio |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|-------|-------|
| | 413.2 µs | 408.5 µs | **~1.0 (within noise)** |

**~0-gain → REVERTED** (the experimental kernel + bench arm backed out via Edit; tree clean). The
hypothesis was **wrong**: the f16 dot is **decode-throughput-bound** (the `vcvtph2ps` + the two loads cap
it at ~1 chunk/cycle), so the `add_ps` latency is already fully hidden — a single accumulator is optimal.
The 4× from the F16C arc (`7239d58`) WAS the bottleneck removal; nothing latency-bound remains.

**Why JL was different (refines the lesson):** JL's xorshift is a **pure-register recurrence with no
per-element load/decode** — so the dependency chain IS the only thing limiting throughput, and a 2nd
register is a pure win. The dot kernels all have a per-element **load/decode** (f16 `cvtph`, 4-bit
`mullo`/unpack, int8 `madd`) whose throughput is the real cap, hiding the accumulator latency. **CORRECTED
LESSON: the "add a 2nd accumulator register" unlock only applies to kernels whose hot recurrence is
register-only (PRNG, pure reductions); a kernel with a per-element load or decode is throughput-bound on
that, NOT accumulator-latency-bound — measure before rewriting (and especially before breaking
bit-identical for it).** The measure-first cost ~20 min and saved a ~0-gain, bit-identical-breaking,
default-path-rippling change. Don't re-attempt 4-acc on any of the dot kernels.

---

## 2026-06-28 — JL accumulate is SATURATED at 8-lane: 16-lane (4-way ILP) = ~1.02× (throughput wall) (BlackThrush)

The JL register-only recurrence DID respond to the 2nd-accumulator unlock: scalar → 4-lane (1.51×) →
8-lane (1.76× more, `abd4628`). Natural question: does **16-lane (4 `__m256i`, 4-way ILP)** give a 3rd
jump? Op-count model said no — the 8-lane already moved the xorshift from latency-bound (1 register, ~6-cyc
dependency chain) to ~throughput-bound (2 registers fill the ~6-cyc latency), so a 3rd/4th register just
piles on `slli`/`xor`/`movemask` ops against a fixed ~3 vector-ALU-ports/cycle. **MEASURED (non-prod
16-lane variant, 4 registers, interleaved):**

| `jl_accumulate` (dim 384, 8k tokens) | 8-lane | 16-lane | Ratio |
|--------------------------------------|--------|---------|-------|
| | 949.8 µs | 930.2 µs | **~1.02× (noise)** |

**~0-gain → REVERTED** (experimental kernel + bench arm backed out via Edit; tree clean). **JL is
saturated at 8-lane** — the 8-lane was the right stopping point (`abd4628`). Confirms the refined model:
the 2nd register (4→8 lanes) is the latency unlock; the 3rd/4th (8→16) hit the vector-ALU-throughput wall.
**General: the ILP unlock is a ONE-STEP transition (latency-bound → throughput-bound), not a ladder —
once 2 independent accumulators fill the recurrence latency, more lanes only add work. Stop at 2× the
in-flight registers needed to cover the dependency depth.** Don't push JL past 8 lanes.

## 2026-06-28 — l2_normalize sum-of-squares: a real ~4.3× LOCKED behind embedding stability (not shippable) (BlackThrush)

After landing the bit-identical scale half of `l2_normalize` (`41b16bc`, ~1.70× on the scale kernel), I
dug its OTHER half — the sum-of-squares `vec.iter().map(|x| x*x).sum()`. It's a **1-accumulator strict-IEEE
f32 reduction**, which LLVM will NOT auto-vectorize (reordering changes the sum), so it runs sequential +
latency-bound. **Measured the speed locked there** (`sum_of_squares` bench, dim 384):

| Workload | acc1 (current, sequential) | acc4 (reorder, auto-vec) | Ratio |
|----------|----------------------------|--------------------------|-------|
| `sum_of_squares` | 35.31 µs | 8.21 µs | **0.23 (~4.3×)** |

So a 4-accumulator reformulation is **~4.3× faster** — and notably it needs NO AVX2/unsafe at all (4
independent scalar accumulators → LLVM auto-vec to SSE2), so it's even **cross-host-consistent** (same
binary everywhere). If unlocked, `l2_normalize` would go from ~1.3× (scale-only) to ~2× overall.

**But it is LOCKED — `REVERTed` the idea, kept only the bench as evidence.** A 4-acc reduction reorders
the f32 sum → `norm_sq` differs by ULPs → `inv_norm` differs → **every embedding shifts by ULPs**. That
is an **embedding-stability break**: a persisted index built before the change no longer matches a query
embedded after it (the stored f16 mostly absorbs the ULP, but the query f32 does not), and results would
silently drift on a library upgrade. This is exactly what the **bit-identical discipline protects** — and
it's why the SCALE half (`x *= inv_norm`, element-wise, IEEE-exact 1/4/8-wide, identical on every host and
every version) WAS shippable while the sum-of-squares is not. The absolute value is also modest (the embed
is a small fraction of a query; `l2_normalize` a fraction of the embed), so the embedding churn is not
worth it even if conformance happened to stay GREEN.

**CLARIFIED INVARIANT (the deep reason every SIMD win this session had to be bit-identical):** a search
library's embeddings/scores must be **reproducible across hosts AND library versions**. Therefore
**element-wise** ops (scale, accumulate, decode, encode, round/clamp, quantize-pack) are widenable — each
output lane = f(one input lane), IEEE-exact regardless of width — but **reductions** (sum-of-squares, dot
accumulators, any `Σ`) are LOCKED, because any reorder changes the result. The element-wise vein is now
mined (model2vec mean-pool + `l2_normalize` scale shipped); the reduction halves carry a real but
unspendable ~4× each. Don't re-attempt SIMD/multi-acc on any reduction.

## 2026-06-28 — limit_all 1.4× decomposed: every component is optimal or inherent — no lever (BlackThrush)

The only surviving BOLD comparator gap is `limit_all` (~1.4× vs the Tantivy-class incumbent; top-k rows
are parity). The swarm has `bold-limitall-*` worktrees probing it, so I decomposed it end-to-end and
confirmed each piece is already optimal or fundamentally inherent — **there is no lever here**:

1. **Lexical (Tantivy):** the incumbent IS Tantivy — can't beat it on its own ground.
2. **Vector tier (full scan):** `limit_all` sets `candidate_limit = doc_count`, so the file-backed
   `VectorIndex` takes the full-recall fast path (`search.rs:170`, single f16 collect-and-sort) — the
   f16 dot is AVX2/F16C (`7239d58`), and the redundant int8/4-bit pass-1 was already short-cut for InMemory
   (`84fbfa2`). Optimal single pass.
3. **RRF fuse:** read + benched (`-p frankensearch-fusion --bench rrf_fuse`): **22.3 µs new vs 29.1 µs old**
   (a prior win already landed). It is comprehensively optimized — `AHashMap<&str, _>` keyed on **borrowed**
   doc_ids (no `String` clone in the merge), a single `entry()` probe per doc (no get-then-insert),
   capacity pre-allocated, `select_nth_unstable` for top-k (full sort skipped), and `into_owned` only on the
   output winners. For `limit_all` the remaining costs are **inherent**: a full `sort_unstable` of the ~N
   unique fused hits (you must rank *everything*), N `entry` string-hashes (keying on a precomputed u64 would
   need cross-layer doc_id-hash plumbing through lexical+vector search — invasive, ~3-5% of `limit_all`), and
   N `into_owned` doc_id clones (the returned `Vec<FusedHit>` must own its doc_ids since the borrowed
   `lexical`/`semantic` inputs are dropped — only the invasive `VectorHit<'a>` lifetime refactor removes it).

**Conclusion: `limit_all` ~1.4× is structurally inherent — frankensearch does lexical + a full vector scan
+ an RRF full-sort where the incumbent does lexical-only; every part of that extra work is already at its
floor.** Stop digging `limit_all` for a per-crate lever; the only removals left are invasive
(`VectorHit<'a>` borrow refactor) or cross-layer (u64 doc_id keys), neither a 60-min win and both
sub-meaningful against the modest gap. With this, BOTH comparator-gap components (vector scan + RRF) are
confirmed optimal — the comparator investigation is closed.

## 2026-06-29 — parallelizing the gather SETUP (rayon `&HashSet::par_iter` + `par_sort`) is a ~10× REGRESSION (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and REVERTED.** Follow-up to the landed gather fast-path (`ec76859` serial, `383ee53`
parallel-dots). The gather's crossover (~13%) is capped not by its dots (already `par_chunks`) but by its
**serial setup** — `allowed.iter().filter_map(|h| map.get(h)).collect()` + `positions.sort_unstable()`.
Hypothesis: parallelize the setup above `PARALLEL_CHUNK_SIZE` (`allowed.par_iter()…collect()` +
`par_sort_unstable()`) to flip the 25–50 % band to wins and widen the gate toward N/2. Compiled clean,
conformance GREEN (index lib 374/374, incl. the parity tests), so it was correct — just **far slower**.

**Measured** (`filtered_gather`, N=50k clustered dim 384 k10, gather median; parallel branch is M>1024):

| selectivity | serial setup (`383ee53`) | parallel setup | scan | verdict |
|-------------|--------------------------|----------------|------|---------|
| 5 %  (2 500)  | 128.3 µs | **1 297 µs** | 180.8 µs | **10.1× slower → now a LOSS** |
| 10 % (5 000)  | 217.7 µs | **2 035 µs** | 194.6 µs | 9.4× slower → LOSS |
| 25 % (12 500) | 726 µs   | **4 052 µs** | 357 µs   | 5.6× slower |
| 50 % (25 000) | 1 170 µs | **6 205 µs** | 794 µs   | 5.3× slower |

(Sub-1024 allow-sets stay on the serial branch and were unchanged — `0.5%`=15 µs, `1%`=30 µs, `2%`=58 µs.)

**Root cause:** `rayon`'s **`&HashSet` parallel iterator partitions a hash table extremely poorly** — a
`RawTable` has no cheap midpoint split, so `par_iter` degrades to high-overhead bucket walking with bad load
balancing, an order of magnitude slower than the plain serial `iter().filter_map().collect()` (a linear
probe-friendly walk). `par_sort_unstable` adds its own spawn overhead at these sizes. The setup is **memory-
/probe-bound serial work that rayon cannot accelerate here**; the win came entirely from parallelizing the
**dots** (already shipped in `383ee53`).

**Decision: fully reverted** (`in_memory.rs` byte-identical to `383ee53` — `git diff` empty before this
entry; reverted via Edit, not `git checkout`, which `dcg` blocks). The serial-setup + parallel-dots gather
(`383ee53`, gate N/10) stands as the kept state. **Route next:** to extend the gather past ~13 % the lever
is NOT parallelizing the `HashSet` walk — it would be a *cheaper representation* of the gathered positions
(e.g. having `candidate_hashes` hand back an already-sorted `&[u64]` slab, or storing the allow-set
positions directly), so no per-query collect+sort is needed at all. Lower priority than the FSVI/lexical
plumbing — moderately-selective (>10 %) filters are the uncommon case, and the serial setup already serves
the common <10 % region well. Original-comparator ratio **N/A** (internal filtered-path micro-lever).

## 2026-06-29 — hash-embedder `tokenize` ASCII fast path is NOT a lever — JL projection dominates (BlackThrush)

**Not attempted — flagged to save effort (the LUT/byte-fast-path pattern does NOT transfer here).** After
landing the byte-class LUT on `count_lexical_tokens` (`d7c8477`, ~1.6×), the obvious next target looked like
`hash_embedder::tokenize` (`hash_embedder.rs:431`): it splits on Unicode `!c.is_alphanumeric()` per char with
**no ASCII fast path**, and it runs on *every* embed (query + each document at index time) — superficially a
broad hot-path win.

**But the embed cost is dominated by the JL projection, not tokenization.** `embed_jl` (the production
default) does, **per token**, `jl_accumulate` over **all `dimension` (384) dims** (SIMD, `4a75fd7`), i.e.
`O(tokens · 384)` — whereas `tokenize` is `O(text length)` and `fnv1a_hash` is `O(token length)`. For an
average token (~6 chars) the JL inner loop does ~384 dim-ops vs ~6 char-classifications in tokenize, so
**tokenize is well under ~2 % of `embed_jl`**. An ASCII byte/LUT tokenizer (≈1.5× on that 2 % slice) moves
end-to-end embed by **<1 %** — below the bench noise floor, so it would be a `REVERT ~0-gain` per the keep
threshold. (`embed_fnv_modular` is `O(tokens)` so tokenize is a larger fraction there, but JL is the
quality-default; and the `hash_embed` bench already mined the embed allocations — `tokenize_vec`→lazy iter,
L2 in-place.) Original-comparator ratio **N/A**.

**Consequence — the per-crate micro-lever frontier is empirically exhausted this session.** Probed with
evidence and ruled out: embedding (JL/mean-pool/l2 SIMD'd; tokenize dominated, above), tokenizers
(`count_lexical_tokens` LUT landed, `code_structure::tokenize` already byte-fast-pathed, `tokenize_lexical`
allocation-bound), core scanners (`canonicalize` nfc/filter/md fast paths, `parsed_query` no-op fast path +
alloc elision — both already landed), search-time reductions (MMR cosine 4-acc **landed** `efbfe33`;
`graph_rank` is scatter-add, `native_rerank` is ONNX), and the filtered vector path (gather **landed**
`ec76859`+`383ee53`, live in the production sync fast-tier). The remaining real wins are **substantial /
invasive**, not 60-min micro-levers: (a) a BOLD **selective-filter comparator row** (head-to-head dominance
number for the gather — needs a fair Tantivy filter-then-search incumbent), (b) the **FSVI raw-mmap gather**
(mutation-safe generation-keyed cache invalidation over tombstones+WAL), (c) the `VectorHit<'a>` /
u64-doc-id-key refactors for the last `limit_all` clones. Pick one as a deliberate fresh cycle.

## 2026-06-29 — wider-SIMD (AVX-512 / VNNI) is HARDWARE-UNAVAILABLE — AVX2 is the ceiling here (BlackThrush)

**Not attempted — hardware blocker, flagged to save effort.** After the per-crate micro-lever frontier was
exhausted, the last "radical primitive" angle was a **wider SIMD** dot kernel above the landed AVX2 ones:
AVX-512 (16-wide f32 / 32-wide i8) or, best of all, **AVX-512-VNNI `vpdpbusd`** (4 int8 mul-accumulates per
lane in one instruction) for the int8 two-pass pass-1. Crucially, an int8 VNNI dot would be **bit-identical**
to the AVX2 int8 dot (integer accumulation — no float reorder), so it would dodge the usual cross-host
ULP concern.

**But the deployment/bench CPU has no AVX-512.** `rch exec` reports the host as an **AMD Ryzen Threadripper
PRO 5975WX (Zen3, 32-core)** with CPU flags `avx2 f16c fma` and **no `avx512*` / `vnni`** (Zen3 predates
AMD AVX-512, which arrives in Zen4). So: (1) a VNNI/AVX-512 kernel can't run or be measured on this host;
(2) it wouldn't benefit this deployment at all; and (3) even on a hypothetical AVX-512 host, signed×signed
int8 (`i8·i8`) isn't a single VNNI op — `vpdpbusd` is **u8·i8**, so it needs an offset-by-128 + correction
(extra work), and a clean single-instruction signed path needs **AVX-VNNI-INT8 `vpdpbssd`** (Sapphire
Rapids / Zen5+ only). And the int8 two-pass pass-1 is **bandwidth-bound** (reading the `N·d`-byte slab), so
a wider *compute* kernel would likely be ~0-gain on the scan even where AVX-512 exists.

**Conclusion: the AVX2 runtime-dispatch kernels (`dot_i8_i8`, `dot_product_f16_bytes_f32`, the 4-bit and
f32 dots) are the SIMD ceiling for the target hardware (Zen3).** Do not attempt AVX-512/VNNI kernels unless
the deployment moves to Zen4+/AVX-512 hardware AND a compute-bound (not bandwidth-bound) kernel is the
proven bottleneck. Original-comparator ratio **N/A**. With this, the radical-lever search space — software
micro-levers (≈15 veins, all mined/landed), wider SIMD (hardware-unavailable), and the head-to-head
filtered comparator (structurally N/A) — is comprehensively closed for the current code + hardware.

## 2026-06-29 — bd-lhck: f16 dot 4-accumulator re-measured now decode is F16C — REFUTED (bandwidth-bound) (BlackThrush)

**Lever tested and REVERTED — closes the open bead `bd-lhck`** ("Re-measure multi-accumulator on f16 dot
kernels NOW that decode is SIMD (was decode-bound)"). The current production f16 vector dot
(`dot_product_f16_bytes_f32_avx2`, simd.rs) is **single-accumulator** (one `_mm256_add_ps` loop-carried
chain). The prior 4-acc refutation (`359863d`) was on the *software-decode* generic path (decode-bound);
bd-lhck's premise — that F16C hardware decode (`_mm256_cvtph_ps`, `7239d58`) removed the decode wall so the
add-chain latency would now bind — is **correct in premise but wrong in conclusion**: the kernel is
**bandwidth-bound**, not latency-bound. Added a bench-only 4-accumulator AVX2+F16C variant
(`f16_bytes_4acc`) and A/B'd it vs the single-acc library kernel.

**Measured (`dot_product` bench, 10k×dim f16 slab, host under load ~13 → 10 samples, CIs OVERLAP):**

| dim | `f16_bytes_new` (1-acc) | `f16_bytes_4acc` | median ratio | CIs |
|-----|-------------------------|------------------|--------------|-----|
| 256 | 3.646 ms | 3.492 ms | 0.958 | [3.56,3.78] vs [3.16,4.05] — overlap |
| 384 | 5.022 ms | 4.772 ms | 0.950 | [4.62,5.58] vs [4.46,5.33] — overlap |

**Root cause / decision:** the dot iterates a **5–7.7 MB f16 slab** (10k×256–384×2B), far out of L1/L2, so a
single accumulator already saturates **memory bandwidth** — extra accumulators have nothing to unlock
(the add-chain isn't the binding resource). The ~0.95 median is within the (overlapping, contended,
10-sample) noise, and is directionally a non-result: the **real `limit_all`/full-scan path reads an even
larger slab → even more bandwidth-bound**, so any cache-resident micro-advantage would shrink further. Not
worth landing regardless — it would also break the **default** f16 path's cross-host bit-identity
(`avx2_f16dot_matches_generic`) for a ≤5% kernel gain that doesn't transfer. Bench reverted byte-identical
(`git diff` empty). Original-comparator ratio **N/A**. **bd-lhck answered: no — the f16 dot is
bandwidth-bound; multi-accumulator does not help regardless of decode width.**
