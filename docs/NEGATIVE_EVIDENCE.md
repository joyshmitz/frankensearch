# NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md — frankensearch perf swarm

> Honest ledger of perf experiments that **did NOT pay off** (≈0 gain or regression)
> and were therefore **reverted**. The point of this file is to stop future agents
> (and future me) from re-attempting dead ends. Every entry must cite the measured
> ratio vs. the pre-change baseline on the same workload.

Conventions:
- **Workload** = the exact bench id (`cargo bench` group/function) measured head-to-head.
- **Ratio** = new_time / old_time. `< 1.0` is a speedup, `> 1.0` is a regression.
- A lever is **reverted** if ratio ∈ [0.97, 1.03] (noise) or > 1.03 (regression).
- Wins (ratio < 0.97, kept) go in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`, not here.

Build/bench protocol (per-crate ONLY):
```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/<agent-lane> \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p <crate> --profile release
```

## Reverted experiments

### 2026-06-24 — int8 ADC two-pass does NOT beat *parallel* exact at top-10/10k (BlackThrush)

**Self-correction of an earlier overstated result.** The `3ecfad8` bench reported the int8 ADC
two-pass ~2.6–3× faster than "exact f16", but that baseline (`topk_exact_f16`) was a **serial
full-sort** pipeline. The **real product** `InMemoryVectorIndex::search_top_k` is **rayon-parallel
+ bounded-heap + cutoff** — much faster. Benching the real shipped methods head-to-head
(`inmem_topk`, 10k vectors, top-10, mult=20, parallel pass-1):

| Workload | exact `search_top_k` (parallel) | `search_top_k_int8_two_pass` | ratio |
|----------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|-------|
| `inmem_topk/dim256` | 306 µs | 373 µs | **1.22 (regression)** |
| `inmem_topk/dim384` | ~400–700 µs (very noisy) | 393 µs | inconclusive |

**Root cause:** the int8 *kernel* is genuinely ~3× faster (that stands — `33fb45b`), but the
two-pass **method** materializes all N int8 scores into a `Vec` then selects serially, while the
exact path never materializes more than the top-k heap and runs across all cores. At 10k the
already-parallel+cutoff exact is ~300 µs; the two-pass's full-N materialize + serial select eats
the kernel win. So the int8 ADC two-pass is **not** a win at this scale/path.

**Honest scope of the kept results:** int8 dot ~3× (kernel, real), recall@10 = 1.0 (real). The
**search-level** speedup only holds vs a *serial* exact — it does **not** beat the product's
parallel exact at 10k. The lever's real upside is at larger N (100k+, where parallel exact also
slows and bandwidth matters more) or the mmap FSVI path (page-fault + decode overhead), or with a
**bounded-heap parallel pass-1** (avoid the full-N materialize). Filed as a follow-up.

**Decision:** the `search_top_k_int8_two_pass` method is kept (correct, opt-in, bit-identical when
recall=1 — proven by `int8_two_pass_matches_exact_topk`; a foundation), but it carries **no
verified perf-win claim at 10k**. PERF_LEDGER corrected accordingly.

### 2026-06-24 — multi-accumulator unrolling of the **f16** dot-product kernels (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** rewrite `dot_product_f16_f32` and `dot_product_f16_bytes_f32` to use 4 independent
`f32x8` accumulators (32 elements/iter) instead of 1, to break the SIMD-add latency chain.

**Measured head-to-head** (`benches/dot_product.rs`, `*_new` = 4-acc, `*_old` = original
single-acc, same process / same CPU, n=10 000 dots):

| Workload | old (median) | new (median) | ratio new/old | verdict |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------------|---------|
| `dot/dim256/f16_bytes` | 12.483 ms | 13.504 ms | **1.082** | regression |
| `dot/dim384/f16_bytes` | 17.486 ms | 18.115 ms | **1.036** | regression |
| `dot/dim256/f16_slice` | 10.242 ms | 14.909 ms | **1.456** | regression (noise-inflated) |
| `dot/dim384/f16_slice` | 13.489 ms | 14.277 ms | **1.058** | regression |

**Why it fails:** the f16 paths are **decode-bound** — the per-element scalar `f16::to_f32()`
conversion dominates, so the accumulation latency the change targets is a negligible fraction.
The restructure (chunks_exact(32) + `try_into` per sub-block + two-phase remainder) only adds
setup overhead. Reverted these two kernels to the original single-accumulator form.

**Connects to historical revert `816963a`:** the human previously reverted `88c291b`
("…multi-accumulator unrolling"), which *bundled* this f16 kernel change with a
`select_nth_unstable` heap-merge (unstable sort → breaks deterministic tie ordering) and a
16-elem unroll. This measurement isolates the kernel part and confirms it is **not** a win on
the f16 (default-quantization) path independent of the heap change. Do not re-attempt
accumulator unrolling on f16 kernels without first making the f16→f32 decode SIMD (a
branchless `i32x8`/F16C widen), which is the actual bottleneck.

**Kept from the same experiment:** the `f32_bytes` kernel restructure was a genuine ~3× win
(decode-bound on open-ended slices, not accumulation) → see `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`.

### 2026-06-24 — f32 slice multi-accumulator portability check (BlueGull)

**Lever:** apply the same 4-accumulator, 32-element loop shape to `dot_product_f32_f32`.

**Evidence:** after the f16 revert, this command fell back local because RCH had no admissible
workers:

```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --profile release --bench dot_product
```

That local fallback measured `dot/dim256/f32_slice` at 1.4206 ms old vs 2.3436 ms new,
ratio **1.650** (regression). A later pinned-worker run with the source hunk reverted
measured the slice rows as noise-only routing checks, not a kept source change.

**Decision:** do not ship the f32 slice accumulator rewrite. The committed lever is only
`dot_product_f32_bytes_f32`, which won on both remote `vmi1149989` and local-fallback checks.

### 2026-06-24 — detached-worktree f16 accumulator candidate (frankensearch-cod-b)

**Context:** a detached worktree at
`/data/projects/frankensearch-cod-b-baseline-20260624T221243Z` was used to compare
`HEAD` plus the `dot_product` bench harness against a 4-accumulator SIMD candidate that was
not on `main`. The accepted release-profile command could not be admitted by RCH (see
Measurement blockers), so the only completed same-worker numbers are Cargo's optimized bench
profile on worker `vmi1152480`.

**Bench-profile RCH before/after (`cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --bench dot_product
-- --sample-size 10 --warm-up-time 1 --measurement-time 3`):**

| Workload | before median | after median | ratio new/old | verdict |
|----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| `dot/dim256/f16_bytes/10000` | 7.1007 ms | 3.9052 ms | 0.550 | routing win, not kept |
| `dot/dim256/f16_slice/10000` | 5.0532 ms | 4.0380 ms | 0.799 | routing win, not kept |
| `dot/dim384/f16_bytes/10000` | 7.0845 ms | 5.7334 ms | 0.809 | routing win, not kept |
| `dot/dim384/f16_slice/10000` | 5.6829 ms | 6.0270 ms | 1.061 | regression |

**Decision:** do not land this detached-worktree f16 accumulator candidate. It regresses a
tracked `f16_slice` workload and conflicts with the stronger in-process old-vs-new evidence
above, which isolates the f16 accumulator rewrite without cross-run Criterion noise. The
follow-up is `bd-gfzk`: attack the actual default-path bottleneck, scalar f16-to-f32 decode,
with an exhaustive correctness proof before rebenchmarking.

### 2026-06-24 — `f16_slice` u16x8 SIMD load (BlackThrush)

**Lever:** mirror the landed `f16_bytes` SIMD-load refinement (`c0e9c80`) onto the slice path
`widen8_f16_slice` — build a `u16x8` of `to_bits()` lanes and zero-extend to `u32x8` (16-byte
stack slot + `vpmovzxwd`) instead of materializing a `[u32; 8]`. Bit-exact (20/20 simd tests
green); the slice path feeds `dot_product_f16_f32` (`in_memory.rs:480`, two-tier quality rescore).

**Measured** (`f16_slice_new` crate vs `f16_slice_old` scalar, in-process; ratios are the only
worker-robust signal across runs):

| Workload | prior ratio (`[u32;8]`) | this change (`u16x8`) | verdict |
|----------|------------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| `dot/dim256/f16_slice` | 0.364 | **0.508** | no gain / hint of regression |
| `dot/dim384/f16_slice` | 0.394 | **0.420** | no gain (≈ noise) |

**Why reverted:** this run landed on a much slower/contended worker (absolute times ~2× the
prior run) and the cross-run ratio moved the **wrong way** on dim256 (0.364→0.508). With no
clean in-process A/B to isolate the load change from the fully-scalar baseline, there is no
demonstrated gain (and a hint of regression). Per "REVERT ~0-gain", reverted to the committed
`[u32; 8]` form. The byte-path SIMD load (`c0e9c80`) stays — it showed a consistent directional
improvement on both dims; the slice path did not. A clean keep/reject would need an in-process
"SIMD-widen + scalar-load" baseline added to `dot_product.rs` (left for a future pass).
