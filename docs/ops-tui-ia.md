# frankensearch Ops TUI IA + Navigation Contract

Issue: `bd-2yu.1.2`  
Depends on: `bd-2yu.1.1` (pattern extraction complete)

## Contract Goal

This document is the implementation contract for downstream screen/workflow beads.  
If a behavior is not defined here, it is out of scope for implementation and must be added to this spec first.

## Final Screen Registry

Screen registry fields are mandatory for every screen:

- `id` (stable machine key)
- `title` (operator label)
- `category` (`overview`, `operations`, `diagnostics`, `evidence`, `system`)
- `default_hotkey` (single-key mnemonic or chord)
- `purpose` (decision this screen supports)
- `primary_widgets` (must-have visual primitives)
- `input_contract` (required context args)
- `drilldowns` (allowed outbound navigation targets)

### Required Screens (Finalized)

| id | title | category | default_hotkey | purpose | primary_widgets | input_contract | drilldowns |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fleet_overview` | Fleet Overview | `overview` | `1` | Triage all detected instances and spot unhealthy projects quickly. | KPI tile grid, status sparkline strip, instance table. | none | `project_dashboard`, `alerts_timeline`, `resource_trends` |

## Global Navigation and Focus Model

## Navigation Layers (priority order)

1. `palette` (if open)
2. `modal_overlay` (help/alerts/explainability deep panel)
3. `status_chrome` (toggle hit regions)
4. `tab/category chrome`
5. `active screen content`

Lower layers do not receive input until higher active layers are dismissed.

## Global Keybindings (fixed)

| Key | Action | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| `Ctrl+K` | Open/close command palette | global |
| `Esc` | Close topmost overlay; if none, clear screen-local focus | global |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Cycle focus groups within active layer | global |
| `1..9` | Jump to default screen hotkeys | global |
| `[` / `]` | Previous/next screen in current category order | global |
| `?` | Open keybinding/help overlay | global |
| `Ctrl+P` | Toggle performance HUD overlay | global |
| `Ctrl+A` | Toggle accessibility/settings overlay | global |
| `Ctrl+M` | Toggle mouse capture mode | global |
| `Ctrl+R` | Trigger reconnect flow for current project stream | stream-backed screens |
| `Enter` | Activate focused item or drilldown | focused element |

## Mouse Hit Region Contract

All clickable UI elements must register stable region IDs:

- `status:<toggle>`
- `tab:<screen_id>`
- `category:<category_id>`
- `pane:<screen_id>:<pane_id>`
- `overlay:<overlay_id>:<control_id>`

Dispatch behavior:

1. MouseDown stores candidate hit region + origin layer.
2. MouseUp on same region activates action.
3. Drag threshold prevents accidental click activation.
4. Wheel routes to topmost scrollable layer.

## Command Palette Verb Taxonomy

Palette actions are structured as stable verb IDs:

- `screen.open:<screen_id>`
- `screen.back`
- `filter.apply:<name>`
- `filter.clear`
- `overlay.toggle:<overlay_id>`
- `ops.capture_snapshot`
- `ops.export_evidence`
- `ops.replay_last_incident`
- `ops.reconnect_stream`
- `ops.toggle_fast_only`

Each verb must define:

- required arguments
- preconditions
- emitted telemetry event
- success/failure result message

## Inline vs Alt-Screen + Reconnect Semantics

## Display Modes

- `alt_screen` (default interactive operations console)
- `inline` (embedded mode for constrained terminals/log contexts)

Mode contract:

- Context state persists across mode switches.
- Overlay stack is preserved where possible.
- Inline mode may collapse panels but cannot drop critical status/error signals.

## Reconnect States

Every stream-backed screen shows one of:

- `connected`
- `degraded` (partial feeds or lag)
- `reconnecting` (retry in progress)
- `offline` (manual intervention needed)

Reconnect policy:

1. Exponential backoff with jitter for automatic retries.
2. `Ctrl+R` forces immediate retry.
3. Last known good metrics remain visible with stale markers.
4. Transition events are logged to timeline + status chrome.

## Cross-Screen Drilldown and Context Preservation

## Context Envelope (must be carried across screens)

```text
project_id
instance_id (optional)
query_id (optional)
time_window
active_filters[]
sort_mode
cursor/selection anchor
```

## Required Drilldown Flows

1. `fleet_overview` tile -> `project_dashboard` with `project_id`.
2. `project_dashboard` latency anomaly card -> `live_search_stream` with `time_window` + `active_filters=latency_anomaly`.
3. `live_search_stream` query row -> `explainability_cockpit` with `query_id`.
4. `alerts_timeline` incident -> `historical_analytics` with incident time window preloaded.
5. `historical_analytics` regression point -> `explainability_cockpit` with nearest relevant `query_id` if available.

Back-navigation contract:

- Return restores prior screen selection, filters, and scroll anchor.
- No workflow may reset context unless user explicitly runs `filter.clear`.

## Implementation Validation Contract

Downstream beads must implement tests and diagnostics against this IA:

| Level | Required Validation |
|---|---|
| Unit | screen registry completeness, unique `id`s/hotkeys, valid drilldown targets, keybinding collision checks, hit-region ID format validation. |
| Integration | navigation layer priority, overlay dismissal order, context envelope propagation across drilldowns, reconnect state transitions. |
| E2E | operator workflows covering all five required drilldown flows, inline/alt-screen mode switching with state retention, command palette action execution. |

Structured diagnostics required in artifacts:

- `navigation_event` (from/to screen, cause, context hash)
- `palette_action_event` (verb, args, result)
- `overlay_state_event` (open/close, layer)
- `reconnect_state_event` (from/to state, retry count)
- `context_restore_event` (screen, restored fields)

Artifacts required for CI/replay:

1. deterministic run metadata (seed, tick, terminal size)
2. structured JSONL logs for navigation/palette/reconnect
3. snapshot captures for each required screen + overlay stack states

## Downstream Implementation Boundaries

This spec is now authoritative for:

- `bd-2yu.6.1`, `bd-2yu.6.4`, `bd-2yu.6`
- `bd-2yu.2.1`, `bd-2yu.2.3`, `bd-2yu.2`
- `bd-2hz.7.1`, `bd-2hz.7.7`
- `bd-2hz.12`

Any mismatch between implementation and this contract must be resolved by updating this file and the bead thread first.
