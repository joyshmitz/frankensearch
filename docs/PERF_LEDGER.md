# PERF_LEDGER.md — frankensearch measured wins

> Head-to-head measured performance wins **kept** in the tree. Each row cites the

> faster). Dead-ends and regressions live in `docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md`.

Build/bench protocol (per-crate ONLY, never workspace-wide):
```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cc \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p <crate> --release
```

Current Cargo rejects `--release` for `cargo bench` in this checkout; successful
Criterion runs use the equivalent `--profile release` form and record that protocol
mismatch in `docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md`.

The dominance baseline is a Tantivy/Lucene/Meilisearch-class original comparator
on identical corpora and query streams. Until `bd-ui41` lands that harness, rows
below are limited to frankensearch pre-change baselines or before/after local
hot-path ratios and must not be presented as original-comparator wins.

**Lever (bd-gfzk):** `dot_product_f16_bytes_f32` / `dot_product_f16_f32` — the **default
quantization** path (f16 FSVI, `search.rs:288,346,441`). The f16 paths were decode-bound: the
per-element scalar `f16::to_f32()` dominated (confirmed in `docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md` — that's
why accumulator unrolling failed here). Replaced the 8× scalar decode with a **branchless SIMD
widen** (Giesen magic-multiply over `wide::u32x8`/`f32x8` + pure-integer inf/nan fixup) →
**~2.5–3.2× faster** on the dominant path. The widen is **bit-exact** to `f16::to_f32()` for all
65 536 f16 values (exhaustive test `simd_f16_widen_is_bit_exact`), and the single accumulator /
lane assignment is unchanged, so every dot score is **bit-identical** on finite data → no
determinism/golden risk (all 19 simd + full index lib tests green). Measured head-to-head in one
process (`f16_*_new` SIMD vs `f16_*_old` scalar). No dominance-vs-original claim (blocked by
`bd-ui41`); pre-change before/after ratio only.

_Refinement (same lever):_ the byte path also replaces the 8 scalar `from_le_bytes` + stack
round-trip with a single little-endian SIMD load (`[u8;16]`→`u16x8`→`u32x8` zero-extend, BE
fallback retained). Still bit-exact (`simd_f16_bytes_load_matches_scalar`). The in-process
`f16_bytes_new/old` ratio improved 0.345→0.317 (dim256) / 0.317→0.305 (dim384), ~4–8% on top of
the SIMD widen. Modest and not cleanly isolated from worker noise, but kept because one SIMD
load strictly dominates 8 scalar loads (worst case neutral, never a regression).

**Lever:** `dot_product_f32_bytes_f32` (used by f32-quantized FSVI indexes, `search.rs:307,372,492`).
The old kernel decoded f32s from an open-ended `&stored_bytes[off..]` slice, which the
compiler could not prove a fixed width for and so did not vectorize the `from_le_bytes`
decode. Rewriting the decode over fixed `[u8; 32]` sub-blocks (+ 4 independent f32x8
accumulators) lets it vectorize → **~2.7–3.0× faster**. Measured head-to-head in one
process via `benches/dot_product.rs` (`f32_bytes_new` vs `f32_bytes_old`), so the ratio is
immune to which rch worker the run landed on. f16 paths were tried with the same restructure
but **regressed** (decode is scalar-bound there) and were reverted — see
`docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md`. No dominance-vs-original claim (blocked by `bd-ui41`); this is a
frankensearch pre-change before/after ratio only.

`BlueGull` confirmation command:
```bash
RCH_WORKER=vmi1149989 \
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a \
  rch exec -- cargo bench -p frankensearch-index --profile release --bench dot_product
```
Same worker conformance gate:
```bash
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/data/projects/.rch-targets/frankensearch-cod-a \
  rch exec -- cargo test -p frankensearch-index simd --profile release
```
Result: 18 relevant SIMD tests passed; RCH reported `remote vmi1149989`.

## Foundational primitives & lever validations (not yet product wins)

These are measured de-risking results for levers that are not yet wired into the search
path. They are **not** search speedups — they tell us whether a bigger build is worth it.

### int8 dot kernel (`dot_i8_i8`) — validates the `bd-b5wl` ADC pass-1 premise

Added a tested, exported symmetric int8 dot primitive (`crates/frankensearch-index/src/simd.rs`,
SIMD via `wide::i16x8::mul_widen`; exhaustive-ish correctness test incl. the i32 overflow
worst case). Benched head-to-head against the optimized f16 dot **in the same process/run**:

| Workload | `i8_dot` (int8) | `f16_bytes_new` (optimized f16) | int8/f16 ratio |
|----------|-----------------|---------------------------------|----------------|
| `dot/dim256` (n=10k) | 368 µs | 1.113 ms | **0.331** (~3.0×) |
| `dot/dim384` (n=10k) | 505 µs | 1.622 ms | **0.311** (~3.2×) |

**Conclusion:** scoring all N with int8 is ~3× faster than the current exact f16 scan (½ the
bytes + integer `mul_widen` MAC, no f16 decode). This **validates building the int8 ADC two-pass
scan** (`bd-b5wl`): a pass-1 int8 sweep over all N + an exact f16 rescore of only `k·mult`
candidates should net ~2.5–3× on the vector scan. **Caveat:** this is a kernel-throughput ratio,
**not** a search speedup — the product win requires the sidecar + two-pass wiring + a recall@10
gate (it's approximate). The primitive is unused by the search path until that lands.

**Recall gate measured (`int8_two_pass_recall_at_10`):** int8 pass-1 (top `k·mult`) + exact f16
rescore recovers the true f16 top-10 with **recall@10 = 1.0000** at `mult=20` (top-200 of 3000
random L2-normalized vectors, averaged over 25 queries). So at a modest multiplier the two-pass
is **lossless** here. Both ADC gates now pass: ~3× pass-1 speed **and** recall = 1.0. **Caveat:**
random vectors have wide angular spread; real (clustered) embeddings may need a higher `mult` —
the production wiring must re-measure recall on a real corpus and tune `mult`/quant granularity.
Remaining for the product win: int8 sidecar + two-pass scan wiring + the recall gate on a real
corpus (`bd-b5wl`).

These rows are routing evidence for future levers, not wins.
