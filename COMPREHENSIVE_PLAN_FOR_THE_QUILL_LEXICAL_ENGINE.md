# COMPREHENSIVE PLAN FOR THE DESIGN OF QUILL

*A blank-slate, memory-safe, ultra-high-performance lexical (BM25 full-text) indexing and search engine in pure Rust, built entirely on the frankensearch/asupersync foundation with zero new external dependencies, designed to completely replace Tantivy inside frankensearch and to leapfrog it on indexing throughput — especially on Apple Silicon and high-core-count AMD/Intel CPUs — while producing conformant results, with Tantivy retained as a pinned conformance oracle.*

**Status:** Design plan (pre-implementation). **Tracking:** beads epic family `quill` (see §19). **Oracle:** tantivy `0.26.1` (pinned, `Cargo.lock`).

---

## 0. The Thesis: What "Leapfrog" Actually Means Here

Tantivy is an excellent general-purpose search library — and that is precisely why it is beatable *inside frankensearch*. Tantivy is a faithful architectural descendant of Lucene, and it inherits Lucene's fossils: decisions that were correct for a 2005-era JVM server indexing the open web, transplanted into a 2020s Rust library, then adopted by frankensearch which uses a *narrow, well-bounded slice* of the surface (§3) on a *specific workload* (local codebases/monorepos, 10k–1M docs, watch-mode incremental updates) with a *specific runtime* (asupersync structured concurrency) that tantivy knows nothing about.

The measured facts that make the leapfrog credible:

1. **frankensearch exercises a narrow waist.** The complete tantivy surface census (§3) shows: default BM25 only, five collectors' worth of behavior expressible as one top-k kernel, six query types (four of which are trivial), one FAST column, one custom analyzer family, no facets, no aggregations, no custom scorers, no JSON/date/ip fields. A ground-up engine does not have to be "a better Tantivy" — it has to be a better *this*.

2. **Tantivy pays taxes frankensearch never uses.**
   - **The merge tax.** Tantivy's LSM-ish segment model merges by *decoding and re-encoding* every posting list. frankensearch's own `cass_compat.rs` had to grow `force_merge_bounded`, merge cooldowns, and custom merge-policy plumbing just to keep this tax survivable. Quill's docid-range discipline makes merge a *streaming concatenation with O(1) block rebase* (§7) — near-memcpy, no decode.
   - **The doc-store tax.** Tantivy lz4-compresses stored fields into its doc store on the ingest path. frankensearch already owns canonical document storage (FrankenSQLite metadata + content); the CASS schema already marks `content` as indexed-not-stored and hydrates from canonical storage. Quill stores only what retrieval needs (id map, snippets source policy per field) and pays no generic compressed doc store.
   - **The visibility tax.** Tantivy requires `commit` + reader `reload` for searchability (frankensearch calls both, every batch, on the watch-mode hot path). Quill's in-memory delta segment is searchable immediately upon ingest with epoch-published snapshots — commit becomes a durability event, not a visibility event.
   - **The generality tax.** Tantivy's writer pipeline routes every document through a generic schema/`Value` machinery, per-field dynamic dispatch, and a stacker arena keyed by term bytes. Quill compiles frankensearch's two concrete schemas (default 5-field, chunk-policy fields) into monomorphic ingest paths with SIMD-classified tokenization feeding columnar term-id streams (§6.2).

3. **The runtime mismatch is real.** Today, tantivy's blocking calls run *inline inside async fns* on asupersync workers (`crates/frankensearch-lexical/src/lib.rs` — `_cx` is unused in the search paths), because tantivy predates and ignores structured concurrency. Quill is asupersync-native from byte zero: `Cx` threading, cancel-correct writer paths, `spawn_blocking` where appropriate, and — decisively for verification — the entire engine runs under `LabRuntime` with virtual time and deterministic scheduling, which tantivy structurally cannot.

4. **High-core-count CPUs punish tantivy's write path shape.** Tantivy parallelizes indexing across writer threads, but the endgame is always the same funnel: segment serialization, then merges that re-encode everything, coordinated through a single `IndexWriter`. frankensearch's CASS path already fights this with rayon `par_chunks` around `IndexWriter::run` and a 32-thread clamp. Quill's share-nothing shard-per-worker design (§6.1) has *no shared mutable state* on the ingest hot path, and its merge=concat property means adding cores adds throughput all the way through sealing, not just through tokenization. On Apple Silicon, work-stealing over small shard batches handles P/E-core asymmetry naturally; on 32–96-core x86, disjoint docid ranges mean workers never contend.

5. **Memory safety is a feature tantivy cannot retrofit.** Tantivy contains substantial `unsafe` and pulls ~40 transitive dependencies into the `lexical` feature. Quill is written under the workspace lint wall (`unsafe_code = "deny"`, clippy pedantic+nursery) with at most the single, ledgered mmap allowance the FSVI reader already uses — and zero new external dependencies (§1).

**The leapfrog is therefore a composition of five bets:**

| # | Bet | One-line statement | Why tantivy can't follow |
|---|-----|--------------------|--------------------------|
| **Q1** | **Merge = Concat** | Disjoint, contiguous docid ranges per ingest shard make segment merge an ordered streaming concatenation with O(1) posting-block rebase; compaction re-encodes only tombstone-dense segments. | Tantivy's docids are per-segment-dense by construction; merge must renumber every posting. This is load-bearing Lucene heritage. |
| **Q2** | **Columnar sort-based ingest** | Tokenize into flat `(term_id, doc_ordinal, pos)` columns in bump arenas; radix-partition by term at flush. Cache-shaped sequential passes replace per-token hashmap random access. | Tantivy's stacker/expull hashmap-per-term is fixed architecture; the write path cannot become columnar without a rewrite. |
| **Q3** | **Searchable delta, durable seal** | An always-searchable in-memory delta segment (epoch/Arc-swap published) decouples visibility from durability; `commit` = seal + fsync + manifest publish only. | Tantivy couples visibility to commit+reload; NRT-style reopen is its floor. |
| **Q4** | **Schema-specialized SIMD front-end** | The analyzer chain (fused simple+lowercase; CASS hyphen/CJK/edge-ngram family) compiles to SIMD/SWAR byte-classification kernels with byte-parity tests against the shipping scalar implementations. | Tantivy's tokenizer API is a generic char-iterator pipeline; per-byte dispatch is its floor. |
| **Q5** | **Verified conformance, honest speed** | Tantivy stays in-tree as a pinned oracle behind a non-default feature; a differential gauntlet (rank-conformance classes, metamorphic suites, crash matrices, LabRuntime determinism) plus keep-gated honest benchmarks certify "same results, faster" before the default flips. | Not a capability gap — a discipline tantivy consumers don't get for free. The gauntlet is what makes the replacement safe. |

**Anti-goals of this document.** No "temporary" second-class mode: Quill at 1.0 serves every query the default lexical path serves today, byte-compatible with frankensearch's public behavior (§5). No format compromises "to be fixed later": FSLX (§10) is versioned, checksummed, and repair-trailer-ready from the first byte. No benchmark theater: every performance claim in §14 follows the keep-gate rules (release-perf profile, cv_pct, pass-over-pass ratchet, MT8 attribution) and lands in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md` / `docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md` under the house rules. The cass tantivy-format interop (§3.4) is explicitly out of Quill's scope and stays tantivy-gated until the external cass tool migrates.

---

## 1. Constraints and Non-Negotiables

1. **The dependency universe is closed.** Quill adds **zero new external dependencies**. Allowed: the existing workspace dependency set — `asupersync` (runtime, channels, sync, LabRuntime), `rayon` (CPU-bound data parallelism only), `wide`/`bytemuck` (portable SIMD), `memmap2` (read-side mapping, same allowance discipline as FSVI), `compact_str`, `ahash`, `crc32fast`, `xxhash-rust` (xxh3), `thiserror`, `tracing`, `serde`/`serde_json` (**never** for durable formats — manifest and segment bytes are hand-rolled §10), `unicode-normalization`, and in-house family crates (`fsqlite-*` via frankensearch-storage, frankensearch-core/-durability). `tantivy 0.26.1` remains **only** as the pinned conformance oracle and the cass-interop backend, behind non-default features. No new crates.io deps, full stop.
2. **Memory safety is structural.** Quill crates carry `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` at the crate root. The single exception class is the mmap read path, which follows the exact house precedent (`frankensearch-index`, `frankensearch-durability`): workspace lint `unsafe_code = "deny"` with a narrowly scoped, commented `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` **only** in the module that materializes a `memmap2` map, exposing a safe API. If Quill can reuse a shared safe mmap facade from `frankensearch-index`, it does that instead and stays at `forbid`. Every SIMD kernel is safe code (`wide`/SWAR); no `core::arch` intrinsics.
3. **asupersync only; `Cx` everywhere.** Every Quill operation that blocks, locks, or does I/O takes `&Cx` and honors cancellation. Long CPU/I-O work on async paths goes through `spawn_blocking` or executes inline *by documented contract* where the caller requires it (the fusion rayon path **requires** `search_fusion_candidates` to resolve without yielding `Pending` — `crates/frankensearch-fusion/src/searcher.rs:1270-1290`; Quill honors this with a fully synchronous read path wrapped in an immediately-ready future). Background work (merges, compaction) lives in asupersync regions with two-phase channels — no detached threads. Tokio and its ecosystem remain forbidden.
4. **Conformance before default.** The `lexical` feature default does not flip to Quill until the gauntlet gates in §15/§18 pass: rank-conformance on the differential corpus with all divergences classified, crash-matrix green, hybrid-fusion end-to-end quality unchanged (nDCG/MRR/Recall with bootstrap CIs), and the perf gates of §14 met with keep-gate-clean evidence.
5. **Determinism is a contract, not a vibe.** Same corpus + same ingest order + same config ⇒ byte-identical sealed segments and identical query results, including tie order (§8.4). Same corpus in *any* ingest order ⇒ identical result *sets* and identical scores; rank ties broken by the documented deterministic key. Concurrent ingest schedules may vary docid assignment across shards, but a `deterministic_ingest` mode (single-shard or round-robin-sealed) exists for replay/testing and is what LabRuntime suites use.
6. **Durable formats are hand-written and versioned.** FSLX files carry magic, format version, section table, per-section checksums (xxh3-64 fast path + crc32 trailer, matching the durability crate's conventions), little-endian fixed-width integers, and explicit alignment (§10). No serde-derived durable bytes. Every format change bumps the version and adds an entry to the format registry table in §10.6. Repair trailers / RaptorQ sidecars via the existing generic `FileProtector` work on day one.
7. **The house workflow binds this project.** Beads (`br`) for tracking with the epic/dependency structure of §19; `br sync --flush-only` + manual commits; UBS before commits; `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo check --workspace --all-targets`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo test` gates; RCH offload for heavy builds/benches; Agent Mail file reservations when swarm-executed; negative results ledgered in `docs/NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md` with the Ratio convention; wins in `docs/PERF_LEDGER.md`.
8. **Prohibited shortcuts (constitutional).** No global-lock "interim" writer presented as the engine; no `HashMap<String, Vec<u32>>` presented as an index; no visibility-without-durability presented as commit; no benchmark run without the oracle side under identical analyzer/config; no conformance claim from a corpus the engine was tuned on without a held-out fixture; no silent semantic divergence — every intentional divergence from tantivy behavior is recorded in the Divergence Register (§15.6) with a classification and a consumer-impact note.
9. **Scope honesty.** Quill 1.0 replaces the **default frankensearch lexical path** (`TantivyIndex` + the `LexicalSearch` trait duties + fsfs/facade integration + snippets + the wildcard/boolean/range/phrase query surface of §5). Quill 1.0 does **not** reimplement the tantivy on-disk format: `cass_compat.rs` (external CASS tool interop, schema v8 on-disk tantivy indexes) remains tantivy-backed behind an opt-in `cass-compat` feature until the external tool migrates (§16.3). FTS5 remains the storage-integrated alternative it is today.

## 2. Foundation Audit: Exactly What We Stand On

This section maps *specific existing assets* to *specific Quill subsystems*. The leapfrog claim is only credible because most of the hard, non-lexical problems are already solved in-tree.

### 2.1 frankensearch-core: the seam and the contracts

| Asset | Location | Quill use |
|---|---|---|
| `LexicalSearch` trait (dyn-compatible, boxed `SearchFuture`) | `crates/frankensearch-core/src/traits.rs:600-692` | **The** integration seam. Quill implements it; fusion consumes `Arc<dyn LexicalSearch>` (`fusion/src/searcher.rs:129`) and never names a concrete engine. Two prior implementations prove the seam: `TantivyIndex` (`lexical/src/lib.rs:1335`), `Fts5LexicalSearch` (`storage/src/fts5_adapter.rs:343`). |
| `ScoredResult`, `DocId = CompactString`, `ScoreSource::Lexical`, `IndexableDocument` | `core/src/types.rs:15,31,179,198` | Quill's output/input types, unchanged. Rank is positional in the returned slice ⇒ Quill returns score-desc order with the deterministic tie-break of §8.4. |
| `SearchError` (`SubsystemError{subsystem}`, `IndexNotFound`, `Cancelled`, `Io`, `InvalidConfig`) | `core/src/error.rs` | Quill maps errors with `subsystem: "quill"` mirroring the uniform tantivy bridge; writer-lock cancellation → `Cancelled{phase}`. |
| Canonicalizer, `QueryClass` | `core/src/{canonicalize,query_class}.rs` | Upstream of Quill; unchanged. Quill receives already-canonicalized queries from the searcher. |
| `metrics_eval` (nDCG/MRR/Recall/MAP, bootstrap CI/compare, CV/outlier guards) | `core/src/metrics_eval.rs:25-624` | The statistical engine of the conformance/quality gates (§15.4, §18 G3). |
| Core SIMD module | `core/src/simd.rs` | Reference patterns for safe `wide` kernels. |

### 2.2 frankensearch-index: the format school

| Asset | Location | Quill use |
|---|---|---|
| FSVI binary format discipline: magic `b"FSVI"`, version, variable header + `header_crc32`, 64-byte alignment, tombstone record flags, mmap read path behind a scoped allow | `crates/frankensearch-index/src/lib.rs:6-113,234` | The house style FSLX imitates (§10): same magic/version/CRC/alignment/tombstone-flag conventions, same mmap allowance discipline, same `SearchError::IndexCorrupted` validation posture. |
| Append-only WAL module with compaction + `compaction_gen` staleness byte | `index/src/wal.rs` | Direct pattern for Quill's ingest journal option (§11.4) and the staleness handshake between manifest and segments. |
| Two-phase top-k (score first, materialize ids for winners), NaN-safe `total_cmp` heaps, `PARALLEL_THRESHOLD = 10_000` rayon gate | `index/src/search.rs` | The top-k collector shape Argus reuses (§9.3); the same threshold philosophy for parallel query fan-out. |
| Runtime SIMD dispatch precedent (`wide` portable + feature-detected kernels) | `index/src/simd.rs:6-232` | Kernel organization pattern for Quill's decode/score loops. |

### 2.3 frankensearch-lexical: the incumbent (and the oracle)

| Asset | Location | Quill use |
|---|---|---|
| Fused `FrankensearchTokenizer` (simple+lowercase, ASCII fast path) | `lexical/src/lib.rs:466` | The byte-parity **reference** for Quill's default analyzer (§8.1). The existing parity tests (vs `SimpleTokenizer`+`LowerCaser`) transfer to Quill's SIMD implementation verbatim. |
| CASS analyzer family: `CassTokenizer`, `HyphenDecompose`, `CjkBigramDecompose`, `CassNormalizeAndLimit`, edge n-grams, preview builder — all with fast/slow parity oracles | `lexical/src/cass_compat.rs:58-1674` | The token-level semantics Quill's analyzer framework must be able to express (§8.2); the `#[doc(hidden)]` slow oracles become conformance fixtures. |
| The complete query surface: lenient 2-field `QueryParser` w/ title boost 2.0, 10k-char truncation, count-free top-k gate; CASS boolean grammar (OR-tighter-than-AND, NOT via `Must(All)+MustNot`), `CassWildcardPattern` (glob→regex), i64 range filters | `lexical/src/lib.rs:226-365,913;` `cass_compat.rs:1798-2347` | The Language Contract input (§5, §8.3). Note the wildcard source language is **globs**, so Argus needs a glob-automaton term matcher, not a regex engine. |
| `ord` FAST column + `ord_table.json` sidecar id-materialization | `lexical/src/lib.rs:1184` | The problem Quill dissolves: docid↔`DocId` mapping is a first-class FSLX section (§10.3), no sidecar, no fallback path. |
| 90 unit tests incl. tokenizer byte-parity, CJK e2e, ranking/boost/upsert/delete semantics | `lexical/src/{lib,cass_compat}.rs` | Behavioral spec harvest: each test that encodes *engine-visible semantics* is ported to the engine-agnostic conformance suite (§15.3) and must pass against **both** engines. |
| 15 benches (5 pure-algorithm parity A/Bs; index-layout/id-materialization/count-free gates) | `lexical/benches/` | Baseline harnesses for §14; the `bench-internals` same-binary A/B convention carries over. |

### 2.4 frankensearch-durability, -storage, -fsfs, facade

| Asset | Location | Quill use |
|---|---|---|
| Generic `FileProtector`, repair trailer format (`FSDR`, xxh3-64 source hash, crc32, v2), atomic temp+rename sidecars, verify-and-repair-on-open | `durability/src/{repair_trailer,fsvi_protector}.rs` | FSLX segments and manifests get `.fec` protection through the *generic* path — no per-engine wrapper needed (the tantivy wrapper's per-segment-file enumeration complexity disappears because FSLX is one file per segment §10.1). |
| FrankenSQLite storage: canonical docs, content-hash dedup, durable embedding job queue, `claim_batch(32)` worker pattern | `storage/src/{pipeline,job_queue,content_hash}.rs` | Quill's ingest sits beside this pipeline (fsfs drives both); canonical content storage is why Quill needs no generic doc store (§6.4). |
| fsfs `LiveIngestPipeline`: per-batch upsert/delete + one commit per batch, adaptive `lexical_debounce_window_ms`, incremental change detection contract | `fsfs/src/runtime.rs:1531-2033,659-970;` `fsfs/src/incremental_change.rs` | The watch-mode driver Quill plugs into (§13.2). The per-batch-commit cadence is exactly what Q3's delta/seal split accelerates. |
| fsfs `lexical_pipeline.rs`: backend-agnostic `LexicalIndexBackend` trait, `LexicalChunkPolicy`, `tokenize_lexical`, and the **existing throughput contract** — 20k docs/s initial, 5k updates/s incremental, 25ms p95 | `fsfs/src/lexical_pipeline.rs:18-706` | The mutation-planning layer Quill implements; the contract numbers are Quill's *floor*, not its target (§14). |
| Quality/perf harnesses: `search_quality_harness` (v2, per-slice nDCG/MRR/Recall + CIs), `benchmark_baseline_matrix` (golden profiles, bootstrap compare, CV pre-gates, drift dashboards), `pressure_simulation_harness` (fault injection + goldens), shared fixtures (`tests/fixtures/{corpus,queries,relevance,edge_cases}.json`) | `fsfs/tests/`, `tests/fixtures/` | The conformance/quality gate machinery of §15/§18 reuses these wholesale — swap the lexical backend, diff the artifacts. |
| Facade feature wiring conventions (`lexical = ["dep:frankensearch-lexical"]`, additive bundles `hybrid/persistent/durable/full`) | `frankensearch/Cargo.toml:8-33` | The migration mechanics of §16. |

### 2.5 asupersync: the operating system

| Asset | Quill use |
|---|---|
| `Cx` capability contexts; regions; structured cancellation | Ingest/merge/compaction lifecycles; cancel-correct writer paths (§11). |
| `spawn_blocking` (panic-safe blocking pool) | Sealing, fsync, large merges — off the async workers (§11.2). |
| Two-phase reserve/commit channels (mpsc/oneshot/watch) | Shard feeder → sealer pipeline with cancel-safe backpressure (§6.1). |
| `asupersync::sync::Mutex`/`RwLock` (cancel-aware) | Writer-side coordination (manifest publish lock); read side is lock-free (epoch/Arc-swap snapshots). |
| `LabRuntime` (seeded deterministic scheduling, virtual time, oracles; `test-internals` dev feature) | The determinism suites and crash matrices of §15.5 — the capability tantivy structurally lacks. |

### 2.6 What the foundations do *not* provide (and we therefore build)

The inverted-index core itself: SIMD tokenization kernels, term interning/dictionaries (prefix-block + optional FST tier), posting-list encoding (FOR/bitpacked blocks + block-max metadata + roaring-style dense hybrid), the columnar ingest accumulator + radix flush, the delta segment, BM25 scoring with fieldnorm quantization, boolean/phrase/range/glob query evaluation with WAND/MaxScore top-k, snippet generation, the segment manifest + commit protocol, merge/compaction machinery, and the conformance gauntlet harness. That inventory — roughly 15–25 KLOC of new Rust across two crates (§17) — is the entire build; everything else is reuse.

---

## 3. The Used-Surface Audit: The Narrow Waist We Must Cover

Complete census of tantivy usage (workspace-wide, 2026-07-16, tantivy `0.26.1` default features; 44 files touch tantivy, of which the load-bearing ones are `lexical/src/lib.rs` (2451 LOC), `lexical/src/cass_compat.rs` (3505 LOC), `durability/src/tantivy_wrapper.rs` (1116 LOC), `fsfs/src/runtime.rs`, `frankensearch/src/index_builder.rs`).

### 3.1 What frankensearch actually uses (Quill 1.0 MUST cover)

| Area | Exercised surface | Quill disposition |
|---|---|---|
| **Schema** | Default 5-field: `id` STRING\|STORED (keyword, exact); `content`/`title` TEXT stored, `WithFreqsAndPositions`, tokenizer `frankensearch_default`; `metadata_json` STORED-only; `ord` u64 FAST\|STORED. Introspection by name + option flags. | Compiled-in schema descriptors (§6.4); positions on for text fields (phrase support), freq always; id map + stored metadata first-class. |
| **Analyzers** | Fused simple+lowercase (`FrankensearchTokenizer`); CASS family (hyphen decompose, CJK bigrams, normalize+256B limit, edge n-grams, preview) with byte-parity oracles. | §8.1–8.2; SIMD kernels with the same byte-parity tests. |
| **Queries** | `TermQuery`; `BooleanQuery` (Must/MustNot/Should, nested); `PhraseQuery`; `RangeQuery` (i64, `Bound`); `RegexQuery` **only via `CassWildcardPattern` globs** (Exact/Prefix/Suffix/Substring/Complex); `AllQuery`; lenient `QueryParser` over `[content, title]`, title boost 2.0, `MAX_QUERY_LENGTH=10_000` char truncation. | §8.3 Language Contract: term/boolean/phrase/range/glob/all + lenient parser with identical truncation and boost semantics. Glob-automaton term matching — no regex engine. |
| **Collectors** | `TopDocs::with_limit(+offset).order_by_score()`; `(TopDocs, Count)` tuple; `DocSetCollector`; count-free top-k gate for 1–2 plain terms. | One top-k kernel with optional exact-count accumulation and an id-set mode (§9.3). Count-free gate becomes structural (count is free when WAND is off; exact count accumulated only when requested). |
| **Scoring** | Default BM25 (k1=1.2, b=0.75), Lucene-style fieldnorms; multi-field sum with per-field boost (title 2.0). | §8.4: identical formula, identical fieldnorm quantization table for rank parity, documented FP discipline. |
| **Writer** | Heap budget (50MB default; CASS: threads×128MiB≥256MiB, threads=avail.clamp(1,32)); `add_document`; upsert = `delete_term(id)`+add; `delete_all_documents`; batched `run(UserOperation::Add)` under rayon; `commit`; merge policies (`LogMergePolicy` +`min_num_segments(256)`, `NoMergePolicy`, custom Arc adapter, `merge(...).wait()`, `force_merge_bounded` — *uncommitted working-tree feature with regression tests*); merge cooldown atomics. | §6/§12: shard budgets, upsert/delete/clear, batch ingest, seal/commit; merge policy becomes a small tier policy (§12.2) — the entire cooldown/bounded-merge apparatus dissolves under Q1 (merges are cheap concat; compaction is the only rewrite and is tombstone-triggered). |
| **Reader** | `ReloadPolicy::OnCommitWithDelay` + explicit `reload()` after commit; `searcher.num_docs`; `fast_fields().u64("ord")` (`Column::{first,max_value,num_docs}`); docstore fallback for id materialization; `ord_table.json` sidecar. | Dissolved: epoch-published snapshots (visibility is immediate §6.3); docid↔`DocId` map is an FSLX section; no sidecar, no fallback (§10.3). |
| **Snippets** | `SnippetGenerator::{create,set_max_num_chars,snippet_from_doc}`, HTML render with custom tags, default 200 chars. | Native snippet generator over canonical/stored content (§9.5) with output-parity fixtures. |
| **Segments (durability)** | `searchable_segment_metas()` → `SegmentMeta::list_files()` per-component protection; path-safety guard. | FSLX = one file per segment + one manifest ⇒ generic `FileProtector` applies directly (§11.3). |
| **Errors** | Uniform `SubsystemError{subsystem:"tantivy"}`; `IndexNotFound` on open-missing; `Cancelled` from writer lock. | Same taxonomy, `subsystem:"quill"`. |
| **Concurrency contract** | Writer behind `asupersync::sync::Mutex`; `TantivyIndex: Send+Sync`; **fusion requires `search_fusion_candidates` to resolve without `Pending`** (poll_immediate under `rayon::join`). | Quill read path is fully synchronous under the hood (§9.1) — the boxed future is immediately ready; `Send+Sync` by construction. |

### 3.2 What frankensearch does NOT use (Quill deliberately omits)

Facets; JSON/date/ip/bytes/f64/bool fields; fuzzy/MoreLikeThis/DisjunctionMax/ConstScore queries; custom `Weight`/`Scorer`; aggregation/histogram/filter collectors; custom similarities or per-field BM25 params; 2-phase `prepare_commit`; `delete_query`; index sorting; multi-value fast fields beyond the single u64 pattern. **These are explicitly out of Quill 1.0's surface.** Any future need re-enters through the Language Contract with its own conformance fixtures.

### 3.3 API-shape decision: narrow the seam, don't shim tantivy

The lexical crate currently **re-exports tantivy types** (`Field/Schema/TopDocs/Index/IndexWriter/...`, `lexical/src/lib.rs:34-40`) and fsfs/facade call concrete `TantivyIndex` methods. AGENTS.md forbids compatibility shims, and every consumer is in-repo. Therefore: **Quill defines its own minimal public API** (§9.6) shaped by what consumers actually do — not a tantivy look-alike. Consumers (`fsfs/src/runtime.rs`, `frankensearch/src/index_builder.rs`, facade re-exports) are ported directly (§16.2). The `LexicalSearch` trait needs **zero changes**; fusion needs **zero changes**.

### 3.4 The cass-compat carve-out

`cass_compat.rs` exists so frankensearch can open/write the external CASS tool's on-disk **tantivy-format** indexes (schema hash v8, `<base>/index/v8/`). That is an interop contract with a foreign tool's storage format — reimplementing tantivy's on-disk format is a non-goal (it is precisely the generality Quill escapes). Disposition: `cass-compat` becomes an opt-in feature that carries the tantivy dependency for exactly this module; the default `lexical` path carries no tantivy. The CASS *semantics* (analyzers, query grammar) are still implemented natively in Quill (§8.2–8.3) because fsfs's own indexes want them — only the *foreign on-disk format* stays tantivy-backed. When the external cass tool migrates to FSLX (out of scope here, tracked as a follow-up bead), the feature is deleted.

## 4. SOTA Distillation: The Field, and Where Quill Places Its Bets

Adopt / adapt / reject decisions over the indexing-engine literature and practice. (Alien-graveyard catalog references in parentheses.)

### 4.1 Ingest pipeline

| Source | Core idea | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **SPIMI** (Heinz & Zobel single-pass in-memory indexing) | Accumulate postings in memory per block, spill sorted runs, merge | **Adopt the skeleton** — it is the only sane shape for bounded-memory ingest — but replace the per-token dictionary probe with columnar accumulation + deferred radix partition (Q2). |
| **Radix hash join / cache-shaped partitioning** (graveyard 8.14: per-thread histograms → prefix sums → disjoint write ranges; software write-combining; skew handling) | Make random access sequential by partitioning to cache-sized buckets | **Adopt as the flush kernel**: `(term_id, doc, pos)` triples radix-partitioned by term_id in 1–2 passes; per-partition posting build is then purely sequential. Histogram+prefix-sum parallelizes across cores with zero contention. |
| **Lucene/tantivy stacker (hash-per-term + exponential-unrolled posting chains)** | Amortized per-token appends into term-keyed arenas | **Adapt for the delta segment only** (§6.3), where per-token random access is bounded by delta size (L2-resident by budget); **reject for bulk flush** where the columnar path wins on cache behavior and parallelism. This is a measured bet: E1 carries an explicit A/B bead (hash-accumulate vs columnar-radix) with the loser recorded in NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE (§19 quill-e1). |
| **Thread-per-core / share-nothing (Seastar lineage; graveyard 3.13)** | Eliminate shared mutable state; shard by data, not by lock | **Adopt** as shard-per-worker ingest with disjoint docid ranges (Q1 precondition). Work-stealing at the *batch* level (rayon / asupersync), share-nothing at the *shard* level. |
| **simdjson-school byte classification** | SIMD table lookups classify bytes in bulk; structural indexes | **Adapt**: tokenization = SIMD classify (alnum/CJK-lead/other) + boundary extraction + in-register ASCII lowercasing (§8.1). Full-scan classify is the right shape (memchr-style early-exit fusion is the known-rejected pattern — bd-5hz0 — but tokenization visits every byte regardless). |
| **LiveGraph-style append-only hot logs** | Sequential-only writes for bursty hot keys | **Adopt the lesson** for the delta segment's per-term chains: bump-arena chains, bounded, sealed into columnar form — never a long-lived structure. |

### 4.2 Storage & compression

| Source | Core idea | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Frame-of-Reference / bitpacked blocks (Lucene FOR, PForDelta family)** | Fixed-size blocks (128) of delta-encoded docids bitpacked to the block's max bit-width; freqs likewise | **Adopt** as the primary posting format (§10.4): simple, SIMD-friendly (`wide` u32x8 pack/unpack kernels), and — critically — **rebasable in O(1)** (block stores `first_doc` absolute + deltas; rebasing a block = rewriting one u32) which is what makes Q1's concat-merge cheap. |
| **Elias–Fano posting lists** | Succinct monotone sequences with O(1) skip | **Reject for 1.0** (encode cost on the ingest path, marginal query win at this corpus scale); **retry condition**: query-side profile shows block-skip dominating on >10⁶-doc corpora. |
| **Roaring bitmaps (7.14)** | Density-adaptive containers for very common terms | **Adapt**: postings blocks whose local density exceeds a threshold switch to bitmap containers (§10.4); tombstone sets are roaring-style from day one (§10.5). |
| **FST term dictionaries (7.17, Lucene lineage)** | Minimal automata compress sorted term dicts massively | **Adapt as the cold tier**: fresh/hot segments use prefix-compressed sorted blocks (build-cheap, §10.2); the optional compaction tier can FST-ify large sealed dictionaries. **Not on the ingest hot path.** |
| **Minimal perfect hashing for static keysets (7.15)** | O(1) exact term lookup on sealed dicts | **Reject for 1.0** (prefix-block binary search + two-level index is within noise at our dict sizes; MPH kills prefix/range/glob scans which we need); retry if term-lookup profiles ≥0.1% self-time on real query mixes. |
| **Fieldnorm quantization (Lucene 1-byte norms)** | Doc length compressed to 256 buckets via lookup table | **Adopt tantivy's exact table** (§8.4) — 1 byte/doc/field, and it is *required* for score-parity with the oracle. |
| **LSM merge theory (Dostoevsky 8.6; tiered vs leveled)** | Merge policy trades write vs read vs space amplification | **Mostly dissolved by Q1**: when merge is concat, write amplification of merging collapses and the policy reduces to "bound segment count + bound tombstone debt" (§12.2). Adopt the *vocabulary* (tiering by size class) not the machinery. |

### 4.3 Query evaluation

| Source | Core idea | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **WAND / Block-Max WAND (Ding & Suel), MaxScore** | Skip non-competitive docs via per-term/per-block score upper bounds | **Adopt**: block-max metadata (max weighted term freq per block, 1 byte quantized) in FSLX; Argus uses MaxScore for short disjunctions, BMW above a clause-count/list-length threshold; exact-count mode disables pruning (§9.2). Conformance note: pruning must be provably rank-safe for top-k (it is, by construction) so oracle rank-parity holds. |
| **Galloping / SvS intersections** | Skip-heavy conjunction evaluation | **Adopt** for Must-clauses and phrase pre-filtering. |
| **AMAC / coroutine interleaving (8.17)** | Hide DRAM misses by interleaving independent lookups | **Defer to a post-1.0 lever bead**: batch term-dict probes across query clauses. Requires the batched shape anyway present in Argus's planning; measured entry criteria per graveyard contract (LLC-miss profile first). |
| **Impact-ordered / static index pruning** | Reorder postings by impact for early termination | **Reject**: breaks docid-order invariants Q1 depends on, complicates conformance; rank-safe BMW gets the win without reordering. |
| **Learned/adaptive indexes (8.4, 8.8)** | Data-dependent structures | **Reject** for 1.0 — determinism and conformance first. |

### 4.4 Runtime & verification

| Source | Core idea | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **FoundationDB-style deterministic simulation (6.20)** | The whole system under a deterministic scheduler with fault injection | **Adopt via LabRuntime** (§15.5): ingest/merge/crash interleavings are seed-replayable. This is the house specialty; tantivy cannot do this. |
| **Crash-only design (3.5)** | Recovery *is* the startup path | **Adopt**: opening an index = recovering it (§11.4). The manifest points only at sealed, checksummed artifacts; anything else is invisible garbage, GC'd on open. |
| **Property-based + metamorphic testing (6.12; gauntlet skill)** | Semantics-preserving transforms must preserve results | **Adopt** as the core of the conformance gauntlet (§15.3). |
| **E-graph / certified rewrites (6.6)** | Prove optimizations semantics-preserving | **Adapt the discipline, not the machinery**: every Argus pruning path carries a rank-safety argument and a differential fixture (pruned vs exhaustive) — §15.2. |

## 5. The Language Contract: Exactly What "Same Results" Means

Quill's conformance target is not "tantivy, bug for bug"; it is the **observable behavior of frankensearch's lexical paths**, pinned as a versioned contract (`docs/contracts/quill-language-contract.md`, produced in G0):

1. **Analyzer contract** (§8.1–8.2): for every analyzer in the family, token-stream equality (text, position, offsets) with the shipping implementations, verified byte-parity on the fixture corpora + fuzzed inputs. The shipping scalar implementations are the *specification*; tantivy's originals are the *lineage*.
2. **Query grammar contract** (§8.3): the default lenient parser (2 fields, title boost 2.0, 10k-char truncation, quoted phrases, `-negation` handled upstream) and the CASS boolean grammar (AND/OR/NOT with OR-tighter precedence, phrases, glob wildcards, range filters, CJK bigram expansion) — specified as grammars with golden parse-tree fixtures, differentially validated against the tantivy-backed implementations per query class.
3. **Scoring contract** (§8.4): BM25 with k1=1.2, b=0.75, Lucene idf `ln(1+(N−n+0.5)/(n+0.5))`, tantivy's fieldnorm quantization table, multi-field weighted sum, f32 accumulation discipline pinned. Conformance classes: **RankExact** (identical top-k order under the deterministic tie-break) is the gate for single-segment/equal-stats configurations; **ScoreEpsilon** (|Δscore| ≤ 1e-4 relative, identical result *sets*, rank flips only inside epsilon-tied groups) is the classified divergence budget for cross-segment-layout comparisons where tantivy's own scores vary by segment geometry. Every divergence in the differential corpus must be classified into exactly one of {RankExact-pass, ScoreEpsilon-tie, **DivergenceRegister entry**} — unclassified divergence blocks the gate.
4. **Behavioral contract**: upsert (delete-by-id then add) visibility; delete semantics; `doc_count` accuracy; empty/whitespace query ⇒ empty results; limit/offset pagination; deterministic tie order (§8.4); snippet output fixtures; error taxonomy.
5. **Out-of-contract**: anything in §3.2, plus tantivy-internal observable details (segment counts, file layouts, score values beyond epsilon class) that no frankensearch consumer depends on.

## 6. Architecture: Scribe, Grimoire, Quiver, Argus, Keeper

Quill is one engine crate (`crates/frankensearch-quill`) with five named subsystems and a conformance companion. Data flow:

### 6.1 Scribe — the ingest pipeline (bets Q2, Q4; the throughput headline)

- **Shard-per-worker, share-nothing.** An ingest session (bulk build or watch batch) fans documents across `W` shard workers (default: physical cores, clamped by config). Each worker holds: a docid-range lease (§7), a local string-interner (`ahash` map term-bytes → local term id, arena-backed), columnar triple buffers, and the live delta-segment writer for its range. **No shared mutable state**; the only cross-worker artifact is the manifest update at seal time.
- **SIMD front-end.** Tokenization + case folding run as `wide`-vectorized byte classification with scalar tails (§8.1). Emits token spans directly against the borrowed input; no per-token `String` allocation on the hot path (`CompactString` only at dictionary-insert time for new terms).
- **Columnar accumulation.** Per token: append `(local_term_id: u32, doc_ord: u32, pos: u32)` to SoA arenas (position stream only for position-indexed fields; positions are u32 — a 2 MiB source file exceeds 65k tokens, so u16 would silently truncate phrase positions; tantivy likewise uses u32). Per document: one doc-length entry (fieldnorm byte) per field. This is a pure sequential write pattern — the cache-hostile per-token dictionary-chain append of the Lucene school is confined to the (small, L2-resident) delta segment.
- **Flush = radix + build.** When arenas hit the shard budget (default 64 MiB, config `scribe_shard_budget_bytes`): histogram + prefix-sum radix partition by `term_id` (1 pass at ≤2¹⁶ terms, 2-pass MSD beyond), then per-partition sequential posting-block build (delta+FOR bitpack, block-max computation), term dict build (sort local terms by bytes, prefix-block encode), doc-length column, docid-map section — one sealed FSLX mini-segment, one file, fsync'd by Keeper.
- **Batch API discipline.** `index_documents` is the primary path (fsfs already batches); single-doc `index_document` is a batch of one into the delta. Bulk build (index_builder) uses a high-watermark pipeline: tokenize/accumulate workers feed a sealer via two-phase channels — sealing (compression + fsync) overlaps tokenization of the next arenas.

### 6.2 Grimoire — term dictionaries

- **Hot format (all segments at 1.0):** sorted, prefix-compressed term blocks (~4 KiB): restart-point layout (full term every R entries, suffix-truncated between), two-level index (block-first-terms array, binary-searched), per-term entry = {doc_freq, postings offset/len, block-max summary offset, flags}. O(log B) exact lookup, O(1) sequential scan, natural prefix/range iteration (glob support §9.4).
- **Cold option (post-1.0 lever):** FST-encode dictionaries during deep compaction for large sealed segments; entry criteria: dictionary residency shows in memory profiles. Not on any 1.0 path.
- Term ids are **segment-local ordinals** (dense u32 in sorted order) — cross-segment queries join on term *bytes* via per-segment probes, exactly like Lucene/tantivy; no global dictionary to contend on (Q1 keeps ingest shards independent).

### 6.3 The delta segment — searchable-while-indexing (bet Q3)

- Per shard, a small mutable in-memory segment: term → unrolled exponential posting chains in a bump arena (the Lucene-school structure, correctly scoped: bounded by `delta_budget_bytes`, default 8 MiB per shard, L2/L3-resident).
- **Visibility:** every applied batch atomically swaps the shard's published delta snapshot (Arc-swap epoch pattern; readers never lock). A search snapshot = manifest's sealed segments + the current delta snapshots. `commit` no longer gates searchability — it seals + fsyncs + publishes (durability). This inverts tantivy's model and is the watch-mode latency win: p95 update→searchable becomes microseconds-scale in-memory work.
- **Sealing:** delta budget breach or explicit commit converts the delta into a standard FSLX mini-segment through the same radix/build path (the chains are drained in term-sorted order, so this is a sequential pass).
- **Honest cost note:** the delta is a second read-path implementation (chain cursors vs block cursors). Argus abstracts posting cursors behind one trait; conformance suites run every query class against delta-resident, sealed, and mixed states (§15.3).

### 6.4 Schemas without a schema engine

Quill compiles frankensearch's actual field shapes into **schema descriptors** (const tables, not dynamic `Value` dispatch): field id, kind (Keyword | Text{analyzer, positions} | StoredOnly | I64{indexed, fast} | U64{fast}), stored flag. The default schema and the fsfs chunk-policy schema are the two shipped descriptors; the CASS *semantic* fields (§8.2) form a third. Adding a field kind is a code change with a format-version note — deliberate rigidity in exchange for monomorphic ingest loops. `metadata_json` remains stored-opaque bytes exactly as today; `content` storage policy is per-descriptor (stored for snippet generation in the default schema; canonical-storage-backed for fsfs contexts that have it, mirroring the CASS pattern §2.4).

### 6.5 Naming

Subsystems are module-level names inside `frankensearch-quill`: `scribe`, `grimoire`, `quiver`, `argus`, `keeper` — plus `contract` (analyzer/query/scoring contract types shared with the gauntlet). The conformance harness lives in `crates/frankensearch-quill-gauntlet` (dev-only crate, never published, carries the tantivy oracle dep behind its own feature) — §15.1.

---

## 7. The Merge=Concat Invariant (Bet Q1) — Statement and Obligations

**Invariant Q1 (docid-range discipline).** Every segment S carries a half-open global docid interval `range(S) = [lo, hi)` in its header. At all times, the manifest's live segments have pairwise-disjoint ranges, and every posting, tombstone, doc-length entry, and docid-map entry in S refers only to docids in `range(S)`.

**Allocation.** Keeper owns a monotone docid allocator (persisted high-watermark in the manifest). Ingest shards lease disjoint contiguous blocks (e.g., 64k docids per lease, re-leased on exhaustion; leases are per-shard *session*, reused across watch-mode batches; the unused tail of a lease is *burned* at session end, never reused — docids are cheap, correctness is not). Upserts allocate a *new* docid and tombstone the old one (found via the id-map); docids are never reused. **Docid width:** postings encode docids as u32 (manifest/header fields are u64 for future-proofing). At the design scale (≤ ~1M live docs, watch-mode churn) monotone-with-burn consumes u32 space in thousands of years of realistic updates; a renumbering *deep compaction* mode is reserved as the u32-exhaustion escape hatch (format-registry note, never expected to run).

**Theorem (merge is concatenation).** For segments S₁…Sₙ with pairwise-disjoint ranges, sorted by `lo`, the merged segment M with `range(M) = [lo₁, hiₙ)` has, for every term t: `postings_M(t) = postings_S₁(t) ⧺ … ⧺ postings_Sₙ(t)` — already docid-sorted, no renumbering. *Proof sketch:* postings within each segment are docid-ascending; ranges are disjoint and ordered; concatenation of sorted sequences over ordered disjoint intervals is sorted. ∎

**What merge actually does (streaming, no posting decode):** k-way merge the n term dictionaries by term bytes (galloping over prefix blocks); for each term, copy posting block bytes verbatim and append; because FOR blocks store `first_doc` as an absolute u32 + internal deltas, "rebase" is unnecessary (docids are already global) — the only per-term work is stitching the final partial block of Sᵢ with the first partial block of Sᵢ₊₁ (re-encode of at most one 128-entry block per seam), recomputing the term's aggregate stats (sum of doc_freqs), and re-emitting block-skip/block-max tables (pure copies + one seam entry). Doc-length columns and docid maps concatenate. Tombstone sets union. Measured expectation: merge cost ≈ sequential read + sequential write of the inputs — I/O-bound, not CPU-bound. This is the structural kill of tantivy's merge tax and of the entire cooldown/bounded-merge apparatus in `cass_compat.rs`.

**Two rules that keep intervals disjoint under shard interleaving** (fresh-eyes amendment): because shards acquire lease blocks alternately, a shard's later leases interleave with other shards' blocks in docid space. Without discipline, a segment spanning two leases — or a same-shard merge skipping an interleaved foreign segment — would produce a covering interval that overlaps another live segment. Therefore: **(R1) seal-at-lease-boundary** — a sealed segment's docid range is always a subinterval of a single lease block; lease exhaustion forces a segment cut even if the arena budget isn't reached. **(R2) merge only bound-consecutive runs** — the tier policy sorts live segments by `lo` and merges only consecutive runs in that order; cross-shard merges are the normal case and are exactly as cheap (concat is concat). Together R1+R2 preserve strict pairwise-disjoint covering intervals for the life of the index (burned lease tails are merely unused docids *inside* an interval, which was always legal).

**Obligations (checked by the gauntlet):**
- **Q1-OB1**: manifest validation rejects overlapping ranges (crash-recovery property tests §15.5); merge preconditions assert bound-consecutive inputs (R2) and seal asserts single-lease spans (R1).
- **Q1-OB2**: merge(S₁…Sₙ) is bit-identical to indexing the concatenated document streams into one segment with the same docid assignments (metamorphic fixture, §15.3).
- **Q1-OB3**: BM25 global stats (N, avgdl, doc_freq) are snapshot-level aggregates over live segments minus tombstones (§8.4), so merging never changes scores — differential fixture: query results invariant under any merge schedule.
- **Q1-OB4**: compaction (the only re-encoding path) rewrites a segment to drop tombstoned docs **preserving surviving docids** (no renumbering — gaps are fine; FOR deltas absorb them). Triggered by tombstone-density threshold (default 20%, config), measured at realistic densities per the bd-6m8p lesson.

## 8. Semantics Contracts (Analyzer, Query, Scoring)

### 8.1 Default analyzer — SIMD with byte-parity

Specification = the shipping `FrankensearchTokenizer` (`lexical/src/lib.rs:466`): split on non-alphanumeric (`char::is_alphanumeric`), lowercase (ASCII fast path; full `char::to_lowercase` fallback), no length filter on the default path. Quill implementation: `wide` u8x16/u8x32 classification of ASCII alnum + high-bit detection; runs entirely in-register for pure-ASCII spans (the overwhelming case for code corpora); any high-byte falls back to the scalar char-walk *for that span* — preserving byte-exact semantics including Unicode alphanumerics and multi-char lowercasing. **Gate:** token-stream equality (text/position/offset) vs the shipping tokenizer on: fixture corpora, the existing parity-test cases, property-fuzzed inputs (mixed scripts, boundary alignments at SIMD lane edges), and the CJK fixtures. The existing `tokenizer_char_walk_ab` bench extends to a three-way A/B (legacy tantivy chain / shipping fused scalar / Quill SIMD).

### 8.2 CASS analyzer family — native

`CassTokenizer` (ASCII-alnum runs hyphen-joined + CJK runs), `HyphenDecompose` (compound + parts at same position), `CjkBigramDecompose` (overlapping bigrams, unigram singles), `CassNormalizeAndLimit` (ASCII lowercase + 256-byte limit), edge n-grams, preview builder — reimplemented as Quill token-pipeline stages with the **existing slow oracles** (`cass_char_walk_slow`, `cass_generate_edge_ngrams_slow`, etc.) as parity fixtures. These analyzers serve fsfs-native indexes wanting CASS semantics; the foreign-format interop remains carved out (§3.4). Positions: `HyphenDecompose` emits same-position tokens ⇒ Quill's position model supports position-duplicate tokens (u16 position stream with duplicates allowed; phrase matching treats same-position alternatives as OR — matching tantivy's behavior, pinned by fixtures).

### 8.3 Query surface

- **Default lenient parser:** grammar = whitespace-separated terms + quoted phrases over fields `[content, title(boost 2.0)]`; analyzer applied per-field; unparseable fragments dropped with a warning (lenient); 10k-char truncation at a char boundary. Multi-term default combinator pinned by differential fixtures against the tantivy parser on the recorded query-class corpus (identifier / short-keyword / natural-language slices from `search_quality_harness`) — the *fixtures*, not tantivy's source, are the contract.
- **Boolean algebra:** Must / Should / MustNot with nesting; CASS grammar (AND `&&`, OR `||` binding tighter, NOT/`-` via Must(All)+MustNot) as a parser producing the same algebra.
- **Phrase queries:** exact-position adjacency (slop 0 — the only mode used), evaluated via positions streams with galloping conjunction pre-filter.
- **Range queries:** i64 bounds over indexed numeric fields (`created_at` pattern) — implemented as a per-segment sorted numeric column scan-or-binary-search producing a doc filter (no generic numeric index machinery; the used surface is filter-shaped).
- **Glob term queries:** `CassWildcardPattern`{Exact, Prefix, Suffix, Substring, Complex} compiled to a glob automaton evaluated over Grimoire: Prefix = dictionary range scan; Suffix/Substring/Complex = bounded dictionary scan with SWAR memmem-style candidate rejection; expanded to a bounded term disjunction (limit + deterministic order, matching tantivy's expansion behavior on the fixtures; expansion-limit divergences → Divergence Register).
- **AllQuery, TermQuery (keyword fields), DocSet/id-set mode, (TopDocs, Count) tuple semantics** — as §3.1.

### 8.4 Scoring and determinism

- **BM25:** `idf(t) = ln(1 + (N − n_t + 0.5)/(n_t + 0.5))`; `tf_part = f·(k1+1)/(f + k1·(1−b+b·|d|/avgdl))` with k1=1.2, b=0.75; `|d|` from **tantivy's exact 1-byte fieldnorm table** (decode table vendored as a const, cited to tantivy 0.26.1 source, with a unit test pinning all 256 entries); per-field scores × field boost, summed. N/avgdl/doc_freq computed at **snapshot level** (sum over live segments; tombstones excluded from N at snapshot build, doc_freq left segment-exact — matching tantivy's delete behavior class; any residual divergence classified §15.6).
- **Float discipline:** f32 accumulation in a fixed clause order (parse order), no FMA-dependence in the contract (scalar and SIMD scoring paths must agree bit-for-bit on the conformance corpus — SIMD is used for decode/gather, scores accumulate scalar in contract mode; a `fast_scoring` config may relax to ScoreEpsilon class, default off until G3 evidence).
- **Deterministic tie-break:** total order = (score desc via `total_cmp`, docid asc); surfaced order additionally maps docid→`DocId` only after selection (two-phase, per house pattern). Since docid assignment is deterministic given ingest order (§1.5), end-to-end determinism holds; the conformance comparator canonicalizes tantivy-side ties by the same key before diffing.

## 9. Argus: Query Evaluation

### 9.1 Read path shape

Fully synchronous internals (mmap'd sealed segments + in-memory delta snapshots), wrapped in immediately-ready boxed futures for the `LexicalSearch` trait — satisfying the fusion `poll_immediate` requirement by construction. Per-query: resolve snapshot (Arc clone, no locks) → parse/plan → per-segment scored iterators → global top-k merge → id materialization → optional metadata hydration (Quill keeps `fusion_metadata_is_deferred = true` semantics and the hydrate path, matching the winning tantivy pattern the fusion crate already exploits).

### 9.2 Top-k kernels

- **Exhaustive kernel** (BinaryHeap guard, NaN-safe `total_cmp`, two-phase materialization — house pattern from `index/src/search.rs`) is the reference implementation and the exact-count path.
- **MaxScore** for disjunctions of 2–8 terms (the dominant frankensearch shape); **Block-Max WAND** above thresholds (clause count, list length) using FSLX block-max bytes. Both provably rank-safe for top-k; the gauntlet enforces pruned≡exhaustive on every fixture (§15.2). Count semantics: `(TopDocs, Count)`-tuple requests run counting mode (pruning off or count-corrected); count-free gate becomes the default for plain term queries structurally.
- **Segment parallelism:** rayon fan-out across segments above a work threshold (house `PARALLEL_THRESHOLD` philosophy); per-segment results merge with the deterministic key. Off in `deterministic_ingest`/Lab profiles unless the merge is order-insensitive (it is — merging is over a total order).

### 9.3 Collectors

One kernel, three modes: top-k (+offset), top-k+exact-count, id-set (DocSetCollector semantics for hydrate). `doc_count()` = snapshot live-doc count (O(1) from manifest stats minus tombstone cardinalities).

### 9.4 Glob/range machinery

Grimoire range scans + glob automaton (§8.3) expand to bounded disjunctions before scoring; range filters compile to per-segment docid predicates fused into cursors (filter-first, matching the CASS Must-filter shape).

### 9.5 Snippets

Native generator: given stored/canonical content + matched terms (post-analysis), find best window ≤ `max_chars` (200 default) by term coverage (greedy window over token hits — parity with tantivy's generator asserted on fixtures at the *output* level: same defaults, same tags `<b>/</b>`, documented divergence class if window choice differs on ties → Divergence Register with consumer impact "cosmetic").

### 9.6 Public API sketch (consumer-shaped, not tantivy-shaped)

```rust
pub struct QuillIndex { /* manifest, snapshots, keeper handle */ }

    pub fn segment_stats(&self) -> SegmentStats;               // ops/status surface
    pub async fn compact(&self, cx: &Cx, policy: CompactionPolicy) -> SearchResult<CompactionReport>;
}
impl LexicalSearch for QuillIndex { /* §3.1 duties, sync-in-async read paths */ }
```
`LexicalHit`/`LexicalIdHit`/`SnippetConfig`/`QueryExplanation` move to (or are re-defined in) engine-neutral form so fsfs/facade port without tantivy types (§16.2). `force_merge`/`optimize_if_idle`/merge-policy plumbing has **no Quill equivalent** — `compact` with a policy covers the real need; consumers are ported off the tantivy-shaped calls.

## 10. FSLX: The On-Disk Format (Normative Contract)

### 10.1 Files

A Quill index directory contains: `MANIFEST` (+ `MANIFEST.prev` for the two-slot publish protocol §11.4), `seg-<hex16>.fslx` (one file per sealed segment, immutable once referenced), optional `.fec` repair sidecars (durability crate), and nothing else. Segment ids are random u64 (collision-checked); temp files are `.tmp-` prefixed and are garbage by definition.

### 10.2 Segment file layout (`FSLX`, version 1)

```
[0..8)    magic "FSLXSEG\0"
[8..12)   format_version: u32 = 1
[12..16)  header_len: u32
[16..H)   header: {
            segment_id: u64, schema_id: u64 (descriptor hash),
            docid_lo: u64, docid_hi: u64,            # Q1 range
            doc_count: u32, tombstone_count_at_seal: u32,
            section_table: [ {section_kind: u16, flags: u16, offset: u64, len: u64, xxh3: u64} ],
            created_unix_s: i64, engine_version: u32
          }
[H..H+4)  header_crc32
sections (each 64-byte aligned, order fixed by kind):
  TERMDICT   prefix-compressed term blocks + two-level index (§6.2)
  POSTINGS   FOR/bitpacked doc blocks (+freq blocks) per term (§10.4)
  POSITIONS  optional; per-term position streams (vint blocks), present iff schema indexes positions
  BLOCKMAX   per-block (max_freq quantized-up u8, min_fieldnorm u8) bound pairs + skip entries
             (impact computed at query time with live idf/avgdl — see §10.4)
  DOCLEN     fieldnorm bytes per (field, doc) — 1 byte each
  IDMAP      docid → DocId (CompactString bytes): offset array + blob  (§10.3)
  IDHASH     open-addressed hash (xxh3-64 of DocId bytes — stable, versioned; NEVER ahash,
             whose hashes are not stable across versions/platforms) → docid, for upsert/delete probes
  NUMERIC    optional sorted (value:i64, docid:u32) column per indexed numeric field
  STOREDMETA optional stored-field blob (metadata_json bytes; content iff descriptor stores it)
  STATS      per-field: total_tokens: u64, doc_count: u32 (avgdl inputs)
file trailer: file_xxh3: u64, trailer_crc32: u32
```
All integers little-endian; all sections independently checksummed (xxh3-64, verified lazily per-section on first touch + eagerly on `verify`); the durability `.fec` sidecar protects the whole file (its xxh3 fast-path matches the trailer hash).

### 10.3 IDMAP/IDHASH dissolve the ord_table

Docid→`DocId` is a direct section (materialization = offset lookup + slice); `DocId`→docid probes (upsert/delete) hit IDHASH then verify against IDMAP. No JSON sidecar, no docstore fallback, no reopen penalty (the `reopen_id_materialize` bench class becomes trivially flat).

### 10.4 Posting encoding

Blocks of 128 docids: `first_doc: u32` absolute + 127 deltas bitpacked at the block's width (4-bit width descriptor); freq blocks likewise (width ∥ all-ones flag for freq=1 runs); final partial block vint-encoded. Dense hybrid: if a block's local density > 1/4 (docid span < 512), a 512-bit bitmap container replaces it (roaring lesson, §4.2). Block-max: per block, the pair `(max_freq quantized up via monotone u8 table, min_fieldnorm byte)` — **not** a precomputed impact scalar, because `tf_part` depends on snapshot-level `avgdl`, which changes as the index grows (a seal-time impact bound would be unsound when avgdl later increases). Argus computes the block's impact upper bound at query time from the stored pair with live idf/avgdl: `tf_part` is increasing in freq and decreasing in `|d|`, so (max_freq, min_fieldnorm) dominates every doc in the block. Seam blocks recompute the pair cheaply at merge. Decode kernels: `wide` u32x8 unpack; scalar reference implementation kept for the differential fixture (SIMD≡scalar bit-parity gate).

### 10.5 Tombstones live in the MANIFEST, not the segment

Deletes against sealed segments append to a per-segment tombstone set stored in the manifest generation (roaring-style serialized containers). Segments stay immutable; snapshot construction pairs segment ⊕ current tombstones. Compaction (§7 Q1-OB4) folds tombstones in and drops them.

### 10.6 MANIFEST (version 1)

```
magic "FSLXMAN\0" | format_version | generation: u64 | docid_high_watermark: u64
schema_id | engine_version | segment entries [{segment_id, file_len, file_xxh3,
docid_lo, docid_hi, doc_count, tombstones: roaring-bytes}] | stats rollup | crc32
```
Publish protocol in §11.4. **Format registry:** every FSLX/MANIFEST change lands a row in `docs/contracts/fslx-format-registry.md` (version, change, migration note, gauntlet fixture id) — G0 creates the file with v1 rows.

---

## 11. Concurrency, Durability, and Crash-Only Recovery

### 11.1 Write path choreography (asupersync)

Ingest session = an asupersync region: shard workers (tasks) ← two-phase mpsc feeding batches; sealer task per shard; Keeper's manifest actor serializes publishes behind a cancel-aware `asupersync::sync::Mutex`. Cancellation drains: a cancelled session seals nothing, leaks nothing (arenas dropped, temp files GC'd on next open) — verified under LabRuntime with forced cancel points (§15.5). No detached threads; merges/compactions are region-scoped background tasks whose abandonment is always safe (outputs unreferenced until manifest publish).

### 11.2 Blocking discipline

Sealing (compress+write+fsync), merges, and compaction run under `spawn_blocking`; pure-CPU batch work inside rayon scopes. The trait read paths stay sync-in-async (§9.1) — bounded work, no I/O waits beyond page faults on mmap'd sections (documented, same posture as FSVI reads today).

### 11.3 Durability

`commit(cx)`: seal current deltas → fsync segment files → write MANIFEST(gen+1) to temp → fsync → atomic rename over `MANIFEST` (keeping `MANIFEST.prev`) → fsync dir. Optional (`durable` feature): `FileProtector::protect` emits `.fec` for new segments + manifest post-publish. RaptorQ verify/repair-on-open comes free from the durability crate.

### 11.4 Crash-only open

`open` = recover: read MANIFEST (fallback `MANIFEST.prev` on checksum failure), validate ranges (Q1-OB1) + section checksums lazily, GC unreferenced `seg-*.fslx`/`.tmp-*` files (with the durability crate's path-safety posture; **GC deletes only files matching Quill's own naming schema inside the index dir** — never user files), rebuild snapshot. Crash matrix (§15.5): kill-points at every arrow of §11.3, plus torn-manifest and partial-segment writes (fault-injected via LabRuntime VFS-style hooks + the pressure-harness conventions).

---

## 12. Keeper Policies

### 12.1 Snapshot/epoch management

Manifest generations publish via Arc-swap; readers pin generations by holding the Arc (no reader locks, no reload API — `ReloadPolicy` dissolves). Old generations retire when their Arc count drains; segment file deletion is deferred until no snapshot references them (drop-guard pattern; LabRuntime leak oracle).

### 12.2 Tiering (what remains of "merge policy")

Size-class tiers (delta → S/M/L by doc-range width); concat-merge when a tier holds ≥ `fanout` (default 8) runs; compaction when segment tombstone density > threshold (default 20%). Because concat-merge is I/O-cheap (§7), the policy's only real job is bounding segment count (query-side k-way width) and tombstone debt. `configure_bulk_load` mode = suppress merging during bulk build, one final concat pass at `finish` — replacing `LogMergePolicy::set_min_num_segments(256)` and `force_merge_bounded` (whose memory-pressure motivation evaporates when merge stops decoding postings).

---

## 13. Consumer Integration

### 13.1 Fusion

Zero changes: Quill implements `LexicalSearch` (+ `fusion_metadata_is_deferred=true` + hydrate), returns score-sorted `ScoredResult` with `ScoreSource::Lexical` and raw BM25 in `lexical_score`. `SyncLexicalSearch` for the sync searcher is a thin wrapper over the same sync internals.

### 13.2 fsfs

`LiveIngestPipeline` swaps `TantivyIndex` → `QuillIndex` (same upsert/delete/commit-per-batch shape); the adaptive lexical debounce window can shrink because visibility no longer waits on commit (Q3) — a measured, gated change (fsfs bead, §19 quill-e7). `lexical_pipeline::LexicalIndexBackend` gets a Quill implementation so the existing mutation planner/chunk policy drive it. Status/footprint reporting uses `segment_stats()`.

### 13.3 index_builder + facade

`protect_lexical_durability` switches to the generic `FileProtector` path over FSLX files. Facade re-exports Quill types under `frankensearch::lexical`; feature graph in §16.

---

## 14. Performance Doctrine & Targets

Reference machines: (a) Apple Silicon ≥ M2 Pro-class (P/E asymmetric, 10–12 cores), (b) high-core x86 (Zen 3+ ≥16C, the RCH fleet's Contabo class for CI trend lines with documented noise budgets). Every number is a provisional `EmpiricalGate`, activated only when its benchmark manifest pins: corpus fixture (docs, bytes, token distribution — the golden `tiny/small/medium` profiles + a new `xlarge` 1M-doc synthetic), schema (positions on/off), thread count, tantivy oracle version/config (identical analyzer semantics, identical heap budget), build profile (`release-perf`-equivalent: opt-level 3, lto thin, codegen-units 1, frame pointers), and statistical rule (≥10 runs, median + MAD, cv_pct < 5 or the result is noise). Both engines run in the same harness with symmetric setup/teardown outside timed windows.

| Gate | Target (provisional) |
|---|---|
| **QG-1 Bulk indexing, multi-core** (medium profile, positions on, 8 threads, commit included) | ≥ **3.0×** tantivy docs/s; and ≥ 60% of single-pass tokenization bandwidth ceiling (measured tokenize-only throughput) as the honesty denominator |
| **QG-2 Bulk indexing, single-thread** | ≥ **1.5×** tantivy |
| **QG-3 Watch-mode incremental** (5k-update batches, upsert-heavy) | ≥ existing contract floor (5k updates/s, 25ms p95) with ≥ **4×** headroom on update→searchable latency vs tantivy commit+reload path |
| **QG-4 Commit latency** (100k-doc index, warm) | p99 ≤ 50ms sealed-commit; visibility lead (searchable-before-commit) demonstrated in the harness |
| **QG-5 Full compaction** (1M docs, 20% tombstones) | ≥ **5×** tantivy force-merge wall-clock |
| **QG-6 Query latency** (query-class mix from the quality harness, k∈{10,100}, 1M docs) | p50 parity (±10%), p99 ≤ tantivy per class; no class regresses >10% |
| **QG-7 Memory** | Peak ingest RSS ≤ tantivy at equal budget config; index bytes/doc ≤ 1.15× tantivy (positions on) and ≤ 0.8× (positions off vs tantivy positions-on default) |
| **QG-8 Scaling curve** | Indexing throughput at 16 threads ≥ 1.8× its own 4-thread number (contention honesty gate) on the x86 reference |
| **QG-9 Cold open** | `open()` of a 1M-doc index ≤ 50ms (manifest + lazy sections) vs tantivy reader open |
| **QG-10 Dependency surface** | Default `lexical` feature: tantivy + its transitive tree removed; `cargo tree` delta recorded in the plan's evidence bundle |

Method: the five standing laws — (1) no benchmark-only semantics (durability settings identical to shipped defaults, commits included in indexing numbers); (2) distributions, not averages (p50/p95/p99 + cv_pct always); (3) never hide maintenance (merge/compaction time inside the bulk-index window); (4) memory is first-class (bytes/doc includes tombstones, block-max, idmap); (5) one lever per change with MT8-style ≥0.1% frame attribution, ledgered per `NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE.md` ratio conventions (revert in [0.97,1.03]). `.bench-history` JSON per gate, pass-over-pass ratchet, committed baselines. RCH offload for the matrix; local runs only for flamegraph attribution.

---

## 15. The Conformance Gauntlet (Bet Q5)

### 15.1 Harness kernel

`crates/frankensearch-quill-gauntlet` (dev-only): **Subject** = QuillIndex; **Oracle** = TantivyIndex via the existing lexical crate behind feature `tantivy-oracle`; **Comparator** = canonicalizing differ (rank lists → (DocId, score, tie-group) with tie canonicalization §8.4; snippet/count/doc_count comparators). `EngineIdentity{Subject,Oracle}` stamped on every artifact; oracle version contract pinned to `tantivy 0.26.1` + the lexical crate's git rev. Artifacts: content-addressed JSON envelopes (xxh3 of canonical bytes) under `.gauntlet/` with first-divergence pointers.

### 15.2 Internal differentials (Quill vs Quill)

Pruned (MaxScore/BMW) ≡ exhaustive kernel; SIMD decode ≡ scalar decode; delta-resident ≡ sealed ≡ mixed; merged ≡ unmerged (Q1-OB2/OB3); compacted ≡ tombstoned. These run in ordinary `cargo test` (fast fixtures) + nightly larger corpora.

### 15.3 Oracle differentials & metamorphic suites

- **Corpus:** shared fixtures (100-doc relevance corpus, edge_cases.json) + synthetic generators (Zipf term distributions, doc-length spreads, unicode script mixes, pathological tokens: 256-byte terms, same-position stacks, empty/whitespace docs) + a real-code corpus snapshot (this repo).
- **Query corpus:** per-class (identifier/short-keyword/natural-language/phrase/boolean/glob/range) generated + harvested from the quality harness.
- **Metamorphic transforms:** document-order permutation (results invariant given docid-map canonicalization); duplicate-then-delete idempotence; index-twice equivalence; segment-boundary shuffling (flush budget perturbation must not change results); upsert≡delete+add; query whitespace/case invariances per analyzer contract.
- **Ported behavioral tests:** every engine-visible semantic among the 90 lexical unit tests becomes an engine-parameterized conformance test (both engines must pass identically).
- **Fusion end-to-end:** hybrid pipeline (RRF is rank-only) on the quality harness — per-slice nDCG@10/MRR/Recall@10 with bootstrap CIs must be **statistically indistinguishable or better** (G3 gate); known-item bench (`real_hybrid_knownitem`) re-run with Quill arm.

### 15.4 Statistical gates

`metrics_eval::bootstrap_compare` (2000 resamples, seeded, 0.95) for quality deltas; conformance pass-rate reported per query class with the release decision on the **lower** confidence bound, not the point estimate.

### 15.5 Determinism & crash matrices (LabRuntime)

Seeded deterministic schedules over: concurrent ingest + search; cancel-at-every-await ingest sessions; merge/compaction racing search; crash kill-points (§11.4) with recovery assertions (committed docs durable, uncommitted invisible, no file-format corruption, GC removes exactly garbage). Repeated-seed replay on failure; oracle checks via LabRuntime's invariant reports.

### 15.6 Divergence Register

`docs/contracts/quill-divergence-register.md`: every intentional or discovered-and-accepted divergence from oracle behavior — id, class (ScoreEpsilon / TieOrder / SnippetWindow / GlobExpansionLimit / …), root cause, consumer impact, fixture id, decision (accept/fix), reviewer. An empty register is not the goal; an *unclassified* divergence is the only failure.

---

## 16. Workspace, Features, Migration

### 16.1 Crates

- `crates/frankensearch-quill` — the engine (modules `scribe/grimoire/quiver/argus/keeper/contract`), deps: core, asupersync, wide, bytemuck, memmap2, rayon, compact_str, ahash, crc32fast, xxhash-rust, thiserror, tracing (+ serde_json only for the stored-metadata passthrough type). `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` (module-scoped mmap allowance only if the shared facade route in §1.2 is unavailable).
- `crates/frankensearch-quill-gauntlet` — dev-only conformance/bench harness; features: `tantivy-oracle` (pulls frankensearch-lexical). Never a dependency of shipping crates. Workspace `default-members` excludes it.
- `frankensearch-lexical` — retains tantivy: the oracle impl + `cass-compat` interop. Post-G3 it leaves the default graph entirely.

### 16.2 Feature graph (end state)

Facade: `lexical = ["dep:frankensearch-quill"]` (the meaning of the flag flips at G3 — consumers keep using `lexical`/`hybrid`/`full` unchanged); `lexical-tantivy = ["dep:frankensearch-lexical"]` (oracle/interop, non-default); `cass-compat = ["lexical-tantivy"]`. During G1–G2 the new engine rides a non-default `quill` feature; the flip is a single, reviewed, gate-certified commit that also ports fsfs/index_builder/facade call sites off tantivy-shaped APIs (§9.6). Migration of existing on-disk indexes: none — fsfs rebuilds lexical indexes from canonical storage (already the recovery path); a `fsfs doctor` note + automatic rebuild-on-format-detect covers upgrades (bead quill-e7).

### 16.3 CI

Standard gates (fmt/check/clippy/test) + gauntlet fast suite on every PR touching quill/lexical/fusion; nightly full differential + crash matrix + perf trend (RCH); ratchet state committed. `cargo test -p frankensearch-quill` stays fast (<60s) — big corpora live behind `--ignored`/nightly lanes.

---

## 17. Build-It-Ourselves Inventory & Size Estimate

In-house (new): SIMD tokenizer kernels (~600 LOC), analyzer family (~1.2k), interner/arenas (~500), columnar accumulator + radix flush (~900), delta segment (~800), FSLX writer/reader + checksums (~1.5k), prefix-block term dict (~700), FOR/bitmap posting codecs + block-max (~900), BM25 + fieldnorm tables (~300), boolean/phrase/range/glob eval + MaxScore/BMW + collectors (~1.8k), snippets (~300), manifest/commit/recovery/GC (~900), tiering/compaction (~600), trait impls + public API (~500), gauntlet harness + generators + comparators (~2.5k), benches (~1.5k). **≈ 15–16 KLOC engine + ~4 KLOC harness/bench**, versus 5,956 LOC currently in the lexical crate (which stays for oracle/interop until retirement). Explicitly **not** built: async runtime, channels, deterministic lab, RaptorQ/repair, SQLite storage, RRF/fusion, eval statistics — all in-tree already.

---

## 18. Convergence Gates

- **G0 — Contracts on paper (no engine code merges before this lands):** Language Contract (§5) with fixture corpora committed; FSLX format registry v1 (§10.6); Q1 invariant + obligations doc; Divergence Register scaffold; gauntlet harness skeleton compiling with oracle wired (subject stubbed); perf-gate manifests drafted with pinned fixtures. *Exit: docs + fixtures + harness skeleton reviewed and committed.*
- **G1 — "The engine lives":** single-shard end-to-end (ingest → seal → open → query) passing the ported behavioral suite + internal differentials on the fast corpus; crash matrix green on the §11.3 kill-points; delta search live; deterministic-ingest replay byte-identical. *Exit: `cargo test -p frankensearch-quill` + fast gauntlet green.*
- **G2 — "Conformant at scale":** multi-shard ingest with Q1 obligations verified; merge/compaction live; full oracle differential + metamorphic suites green with all divergences registered; LabRuntime suites green; fsfs/index_builder integration behind `quill` feature; hybrid quality harness indistinguishable-or-better. *Exit: nightly gauntlet green two consecutive runs.*
- **G3 — "Leapfrog, published":** §14 gates QG-1..10 green with keep-gate-clean evidence committed (bench manifests, ledger entries, flamegraph artifacts); default `lexical` flip commit lands with consumer ports; tantivy out of the default graph; README/AGENTS/docs updated; retrospective + negative-evidence sweep. *Exit: the flip commit + evidence bundle.*

Workstream → gate mapping and full task decomposition live in the beads (§19); the graph is the source of truth for sequencing.

## 19. Beads Map (Epic Family `quill`)

Created via `br` with dependencies (validated acyclic via `bv --robot-insights`). Epic skeleton — the beads carry the self-contained detail:

| Epic | Contents | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| **quill-e0 Contracts & Gauntlet Skeleton** | Language Contract + fixtures; FSLX registry; Q1 obligations doc; Divergence Register; gauntlet kernel (oracle wiring, comparators, EngineIdentity); perf manifests | G0 |
| **quill-e1 Scribe** | engine-crate scaffolding (workspace membership, QuillConfig, errors, schema descriptors, tracing conventions); SIMD tokenizer (+3-way parity bench); CASS analyzer family; interner/arenas; columnar accumulator; radix flush; hash-vs-columnar A/B (ledgered); shard router + docid leases (R1 seal-at-lease-boundary) | G1 |
| **quill-e2 Grimoire & Quiver** | prefix-block dict (field-namespaced keys); FOR/bitmap codecs + SIMD unpack (scalar-parity gate); block-max pairs; positions streams (u32); DOCLEN/IDMAP/IDHASH/NUMERIC/STOREDMETA/STATS sections | G1 |
| **quill-e3 Keeper** | FSLX writer/reader; manifest + two-slot publish; crash-only open/GC; tombstones; concat-merge (Q1-OB2/3 fixtures); compaction (OB4); tiering; durability `.fec` integration | G1→G2 |
| **quill-e4 Argus** | parsers (default lenient + CASS grammar); planner; exhaustive kernel; MaxScore/BMW (+rank-safety differentials); phrase/range/glob; collectors; snippets; segment-parallel fan-out | G1→G2 |
| **quill-e5 Delta** | per-shard delta segment; epoch publish; seal path; mixed-state conformance | G1→G2 |
| **quill-e6 Gauntlet at scale** | corpus/query generators; metamorphic suites; ported behavioral tests; LabRuntime determinism + crash matrices; statistical gates; fusion e2e quality | G2 |
| **quill-e7 Integration & Flip** | LexicalSearch/Sync impls + public API assembly; fsfs LiveIngest + backend + debounce retune; index_builder/facade ports; feature graph; rebuild-on-upgrade; consumer-port e2e sweep (all-features matrix); the flip commit | G3 |
| **quill-e8 Perf doctrine** | bench matrix vs oracle (QG-1..10); .bench-history ratchet; flamegraph lanes; lever beads (one per optimization, ledger-disciplined); scaling-curve studies (Apple Silicon + x86) | G3 |
| **quill-e9 Docs & retirement** | README/AGENTS updates; format/ops docs; cass-compat carve-out tracking bead; tantivy default-graph removal; retrospective | G3 |

Every feature bead cluster carries explicit unit-test beads and e2e/logging beads (idea-wizard Phase-6 rule); every perf bead pre-flights the negative-evidence ledger.

---

## 20. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Reality check | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| **Rank-parity with tantivy is harder than it looks** (fieldnorm quantization, segment-geometry-dependent stats, parser corner cases) | The top correctness risk | Fieldnorm table vendored + pinned; ScoreEpsilon class with tie-canonicalizing comparator; parser pinned by differential *fixtures* not source-reading; Divergence Register makes residuals explicit and reviewable; default doesn't flip until G2/G3 gates |
| **Columnar-radix ingest underperforms the hashmap school on small batches** | Plausible — radix pays fixed costs | The delta segment *is* the hashmap school for small batches; radix owns bulk flush only; explicit A/B bead with ledger entry either way (quill-e1); SPIMI fallback is a config, not a rewrite |
| **Positions stream costs erase the indexing win** (phrases must work) | Positions ≈ largest section | Positions encoded lazily per term partition (sequential), skipped entirely for non-position fields; QG-1 is measured positions-ON so the claim is honest; positions-off mode is a separate documented config for corpora that never phrase-search |
| **Glob scans over big dictionaries regress query p99** | Substring/complex globs are O(dict) | Bounded expansion (as today), SWAR candidate rejection, per-class QG-6 gate; if needed, post-1.0 reversed-term tier — a registered retry-condition, not 1.0 scope |
| **Delta/sealed dual read paths breed divergence** | Two implementations of one semantics | One cursor trait, shared scoring; mixed-state conformance class runs every fixture in all three residency states (§15.2) |
| **Crash-recovery subtleties (torn manifest, partial seal)** | Classic | Two-slot manifest, crash-only open, LabRuntime kill-point matrix from G1 — not retrofitted |
| **mmap allowance vs `forbid(unsafe_code)` promise** | One real tension | Prefer a shared safe facade in frankensearch-index; else the single module-scoped allowance with ledger comment, exactly the FSVI precedent; zero unsafe anywhere else, enforced by lints |
| **Scope creep toward "generic tantivy replacement"** | The classic engine-rewrite death | §3.2 omissions are constitutional; Language Contract bounds the surface; new features require new contract rows + fixtures first |
| **cass on-disk interop confusion** | Users may expect Quill to read cass tantivy indexes | Explicit carve-out (§3.4), feature-gated, documented in fsfs doctor + README; migration tracked as a separate follow-up |
| **Benchmark self-deception** | Perennial | §14 laws + keep-gates + oracle-in-same-harness + NEGATIVE_EVIDENCE ratio discipline; regressions replay via seeded harness |
| **Concurrent-agent collisions during build-out** | This repo runs swarms | Beads dependency discipline + Agent Mail reservations per epic; crate boundary (`frankensearch-quill`) isolates the new work from the hot lexical crate |

---

## 21. Rejected Alternatives (Recorded Reasons)

1. **Fork tantivy and strip it.** Keeps the fossils (merge tax, doc store, visibility model, unsafe, dep tree), forfeits Q1–Q4, and creates a permanent divergent fork burden. The narrow used-surface makes ground-up *cheaper* than surgery.
2. **FTS5 (FrankenSQLite) as the engine.** Already in-tree as an alternative; contiguous B-tree FTS is the wrong shape for the multicore ingest and WAND query goals; keeping it as the storage-integrated option is strictly better.
3. **Reimplement tantivy's on-disk format.** Buys cass interop at the price of inheriting every format fossil; carve-out (§3.4) is cheaper and honest.
4. **Positions-off by default for speed.** Breaks phrase queries silently; rejected — positions on, made cheap, with an explicit off-mode.
5. **Global shared term dictionary during ingest.** A contention magnet that murders the share-nothing property; per-segment dictionaries + byte-keyed query joins are the Lucene lesson worth keeping.
6. **Elias-Fano / MPH / FST / learned structures at 1.0.** Encode-cost or flexibility losses on the hot path for wins our scale doesn't need; each has a registered retry condition (§4).
7. **mmap-as-durability.** Manifest+fsync+repair-trailers is the doctrine; mmap is a read optimization only.
8. **serde for durable bytes.** House rule; hand-rolled versioned sections only.
9. **An external-crates shortcut** (roaring, fst, memchr, regex…). Violates the closed-universe constraint; every needed piece is small at our scale and lands in-tree with tests.

---

*End of plan. The beads graph (§19) is the executable form; this document is the rationale of record. Amendments follow the format-registry discipline: change the plan, version the change, land the fixture.*
