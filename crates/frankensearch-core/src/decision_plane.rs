//! Decision Plane Contract: unified adaptive ranking control.
//!
//! This module defines the canonical types shared by all adaptive ranking
//! components in frankensearch:
//!
//! - **Adaptive fusion** (bd-21g): Bayesian online learning for blend weights and RRF K.
//! - **Score calibration** (bd-22k): Platt/isotonic/temperature scaling.
//! - **Sequential testing** (bd-2ps): E-process gates for phase transitions.
//! - **Conformal prediction** (bd-2yj): Distribution-free quality guarantees.
//! - **Circuit breaker** (bd-1do): Quality-tier health monitoring.
//! - **Relevance feedback** (bd-2tv): Implicit boost maps from user behavior.
//!
//! # Expected-Loss Model
//!
//! Adaptive decisions are modelled as expected-loss minimization over
//! [`PipelineState`] x [`PipelineAction`] pairs. Each [`LossVector`]
//! decomposes cost into quality, latency, and resource dimensions so
//! that consumers can weight them according to their SLO profile.
//!
//! # Evidence Ledger
//!
//! Every adaptive component emits [`EvidenceRecord`] entries using
//! machine-stable [`ReasonCode`] values. These records are compatible
//! with the JSONL envelope schema (`schemas/evidence-jsonl-v1.schema.json`).
//!
//! # Budgeted Mode
//!
//! [`ResourceBudget`] caps control how much compute the pipeline may
//! spend on quality refinement within a single query. When a budget
//! is exhausted, [`ExhaustionPolicy`] determines whether to degrade
//! gracefully, circuit-break, or fail open.
