//! Evidence-ledger taxonomy and trace-link model for fsfs runtime decisions.
//!
//! This module defines the canonical evidence events and linkage IDs emitted by
//! fsfs during discovery, indexing, search, pressure management, and privacy
//! enforcement. It extends the core [`EvidenceRecord`](frankensearch_core::EvidenceRecord)
//! and [`ReasonCode`](frankensearch_core::ReasonCode) types with fsfs-specific
//! event families.
//!
//! # Trace-Link Model
//!
//! Every fsfs operation produces a chain of evidence events linked by correlation
//! IDs. The [`TraceLink`] struct captures the causal relationships:
//!
//! ```text
//! trace_id ─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
//!   ├── event_id: ULID (unique per event)                   │
//!   ├── parent_event_id: Option<ULID> (direct parent)       │
//!   ├── claim_id: Option<String> (worker claim on a job)    │
//!   └── policy_id: Option<String> (policy rule that fired)  │
//!                                                           │
//! trace_id is the root_request_id from the telemetry        │
//! contract — it ties all events from a single user          │
//! action (query, index rebuild, config reload) together.    │
//! ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
//! ```
//!
//! # Event Families
//!

//! | Query       | `query.*`         | Search orchestrator, fusion      |
//! | Degrade     | `degrade.*`       | Pressure controller, circuit     |
//! | Override    | `override.*`      | Operator config change, hot reload|
//! | Privacy     | `privacy.*`       | Redaction engine, scope policy   |
//! | Durability  | `durability.*`    | `RaptorQ` repair, integrity check  |
//! | Lifecycle   | `lifecycle.*`     | Startup, shutdown, health checks |
//!
//! # Validation
//!
//! All reason codes conform to the `^[a-z0-9]+\.[a-z0-9_]+\.[a-z0-9_]+$`
//! pattern enforced by [`ReasonCode::is_valid`](frankensearch_core::ReasonCode::is_valid).
//! The [`FsfsEvidenceEvent`] enum serializes to the evidence JSONL envelope
//! defined in `schemas/evidence-jsonl-v1.schema.json`.

// ─── Trace-Link Model ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

/// Causal linkage IDs for evidence event chains.
///
/// Every fsfs evidence event carries a `TraceLink` that connects it to its
/// causal context. This enables offline replay, dependency tracking, and
/// postmortem analysis.
///
/// # ID Semantics
///
/// - `trace_id`: Correlates all events from a single user action. Matches
///   the `root_request_id` in the telemetry contract. Format: ULID.
/// - `event_id`: Unique per event. Format: ULID.
/// - `parent_event_id`: Points to the direct causal predecessor. `None` for
///   root events (e.g., the initial search request or startup).
/// - `claim_id`: Present when an event relates to a worker claim on a job
///   (embedding queue visibility timeout pattern). Format: opaque string.
/// - `policy_id`: Present when a privacy/scope/pressure policy rule fired.
///   Format: `{policy_kind}:{rule_name}` (e.g., `scope:hard_deny_ssh`).
